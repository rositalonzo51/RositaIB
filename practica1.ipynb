      "The object of this book is expressed in the title. It is intended\n",
      "to be a useful book for school teaching, and advances no higher\n",
      "pretensions. Some years ago, at a meeting of Public School Masters,\n",
      "the want of such a book was spoken of, and at the suggestion of\n",
      "his friends, the Author determined to attempt to supply this\n",
      "want. The objections raised to the school histories ordinarily\n",
      "used were--first, the absence of historical perspective, produced\n",
      "by the unconnected manner in which the facts were narrated, and\n",
      "the inadequate mention of the foreign relations of the country;\n",
      "secondly, the omission of many important points of constitutional\n",
      "history; thirdly, the limitation of the history to the political\n",
      "relations of the nation, to the exclusion of its social growth.\n",
      "It was at first intended to approach the history almost entirely\n",
      "on the social and constitutional side; but a very short trial\n",
      "proved that this method required a too constant employment of\n",
      "allusions, and presupposed too much knowledge in the reader, to\n",
      "be suitable for a book intended primarily for schools. It was\n",
      "therefore resolved to limit the description of the growth of\n",
      "society to a few comprehensive chapters and passages, and to\n",
      "follow the general course of history in such a way as to bring out\n",
      "as clearly as possible the connection of the events, and their\n",
      "relative importance in the general national growth. This decision,\n",
      "though taken against his inclinations, the Author can no longer\n",
      "regret, as the social side of our history has been so adequately\n",
      "treated by Mr. Green in his _History of the English People_, of the\n",
      "approaching publication of which he was at the time quite ignorant.\n",
      "On the same grounds of practical utility, it has been thought\n",
      "better to retain the old and well-known divisions into reigns,\n",
      "rather than to disturb the knowledge boys have already gained by\n",
      "the introduction of a new though more scientific division.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Author has not scrupled to avail himself of the works of modern\n",
      "authors, though, in most cases, he has verified their views by\n",
      "reference to original authorities. In the earlier period the works\n",
      "of Professor STUBBS, Mr. FREEMAN, and Dr. PAULI; in the Tudor and\n",
      "Stuart period those of FROUDE, RANKE, and MACAULAY; in the later\n",
      "period the histories of Miss MARTINEAU and Lord STANHOPE have been\n",
      "of the greatest assistance. Greater stress has been laid upon the\n",
      "later than the earlier periods, as is indeed obvious from the\n",
      "divisions of the work. With regard to the starting-point chosen,\n",
      "it may be well to explain that the English invasion was fixed\n",
      "upon, because it so thoroughly obliterated all remnants of the\n",
      "Roman rule, that they have exerted little or no influence upon\n",
      "the development of the nation--the real point of interest in a\n",
      "national history. It is hoped that the genealogies of the great\n",
      "families will assist in the comprehension of mediæval times in\n",
      "the history of which they played so large a part, and that the\n",
      "maps supplied will suffice to enable the reader to follow pretty\n",
      "accurately, without reference to another atlas, the military and\n",
      "political events mentioned. A brief and rapid summary for the use\n",
      "of beginners was originally projected to preface the work, but the\n",
      "brevity required by a book of this description rendered such an\n",
      "addition impossible without injury to the more important part. An\n",
      "attempt has been made to replace it by a very full analysis, which,\n",
      "in the hands of a careful teacher, has been proved by experience a\n",
      "useful method of teaching the main facts of history.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of civilization can be traced in great lines which have\n",
      "more or less followed a similar direction throughout all Europe.\n",
      "The interest of a national history is to observe the course which\n",
      "these lines have followed in a particular instance; for, examined\n",
      "in detail, their course has never been identical. The period\n",
      "occupied by what we speak of as English history is that, speaking\n",
      "broadly, during which the great mediæval systems--feudalism and\n",
      "the Church--have by degrees given place to modern society, of\n",
      "which the moving-springs are freedom of the individual, government\n",
      "in accordance with the popular will, and freedom of thought. The\n",
      "object of a History of England is therefore to trace that change as\n",
      "it worked itself out amid all the various influences which affected\n",
      "it in our own nation. The peculiar circumstances of the Norman\n",
      "conquest prevented the complete development in England of either of\n",
      "the great Continental systems. Neither the feudal system nor the\n",
      "system of the Roman Church are to be found in their completeness\n",
      "in England. The separation of England from the Empire, the entire\n",
      "destruction of the Roman occupation by the German invaders,\n",
      "prevented that contact between German and Roman civilization from\n",
      "which Continental feudalism sprang. And though, if left to itself,\n",
      "the civilization of the early English would have ripened into some\n",
      "form of feudalism, it was caught by the Conquest before the process\n",
      "was completed. The Normans brought with them, indeed, the external\n",
      "apparatus of the completed system; but in the hands of their great\n",
      "leader, and grafted upon the existing institutions of the country,\n",
      "it assumed a new form. The power of the King was always maintained\n",
      "and the power of the barons suppressed, while room was left under\n",
      "the shadow of a strong monarchy for the growth of the lower classes\n",
      "of the nation. In the same way, the Church was always kept from\n",
      "assuming a position of supremacy, and its subordinate relations\n",
      "to the State maintained. The establishment of this new form of\n",
      "government may be held to occupy the first period of our history\n",
      "since the Conquest, lasting till the reign of John. During that\n",
      "time the barons, who had more than once attempted to establish the\n",
      "same virtual independence as was enjoyed by their fellows abroad,\n",
      "were taught to recognize the power of the Crown. The legislation of\n",
      "Henry I. and Henry II., and the establishment under the latter of\n",
      "a new nobility dependent for their status upon their ministerial\n",
      "services, coupled with the incorporation of the national system\n",
      "of justice with the feudal system of the conquerors, united all\n",
      "classes of Englishmen and consolidated the nation, but in so doing\n",
      "raised to an alarming degree the power of the Crown. The miserable\n",
      "reign of John, and the tyrannical use he made of the power thus\n",
      "placed in his hands, called attention to the dangers which beset\n",
      "the administrative arrangements of his father. The total severance\n",
      "of England from France, which took place in his reign, and his\n",
      "rash quarrel with the Church, completed the work of national\n",
      "consolidation, but placed the united nation in antagonism to the\n",
      "throne. The nobility, which in other countries were the natural\n",
      "enemies of all classes below them, were thus forced to assume the\n",
      "lead of all who desired a reasonable amount of national freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The struggle to harmonize the relations which should exist\n",
      "between the Crown and the subject occupies the second period of\n",
      "our history. It assumes several forms; sometimes the dislike of\n",
      "foreigners, sometimes a desire for self-taxation, sometimes it\n",
      "seems little more than an outbreak of an over-strong nobility. But\n",
      "whatever its form, the fruits of the struggle were lasting. The\n",
      "rival claims of King and nation, acknowledged and regulated by the\n",
      "wisdom of Edward I., gave rise to that balanced constitution which\n",
      "in its latest development still exists among us. But it would seem\n",
      "that this great advance in government had been somewhat premature.\n",
      "In other nations institutions resembling our Parliament sprang\n",
      "into existence, and faded away before the power of the Crown, an\n",
      "effect which can be traced chiefly to the strong line of division\n",
      "separating the commonalty from the nobles. Without support from\n",
      "the nobility, and in all its interests in direct antagonism to it,\n",
      "the commonalty, after supporting the Crown in the destruction of\n",
      "the baronage, found itself in presence of a power to which it was\n",
      "unable to offer any resistance. Several causes already mentioned\n",
      "had in England weakened the sharp definition of classes, but there\n",
      "was a great risk even there of a similar failure of constitutional\n",
      "monarchy. It was as the leader of the nobility that Henry IV. first\n",
      "rose into importance in the reign of Richard II., and subsequently\n",
      "obtained the crown. The limitation of the franchise in the reign\n",
      "of Henry VI., and the consequent subserviency of Parliament,\n",
      "were steps towards the elevation of an aristocratical influence,\n",
      "which, had it grown till its suppression by the Crown was rendered\n",
      "necessary, would have reproduced in England the historical\n",
      "phenomena visible in France. Fortunately the nobility were not at\n",
      "one among themselves. The various sources from which they derived\n",
      "their origin, the close family connections, and personal interests,\n",
      "split them into factions, which, taking advantage of a disputed\n",
      "succession, brought their quarrel to the trial of the sword\n",
      "with such animosity that the nobility of England was virtually\n",
      "extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while this faction fight, and the great French war which\n",
      "preceded it, attract the attention chiefly during the third period\n",
      "of the history, a quiet advance of great importance had been going\n",
      "on, sheltered by the more obvious movements of the time. The same\n",
      "spirit which had found its expression in the establishment of the\n",
      "Constitution, had indirectly, if not directly, influenced every\n",
      "class of the nation. The exclusive merchant guild had given place\n",
      "to the craftsman’s guild. The wars in France, the alienation of\n",
      "property fostered by the legislation of Edward I., the Black\n",
      "Death, which had robbed the country of at least a third of its\n",
      "labouring hands, had sealed the fate of serfdom, and established\n",
      "in England the great class of free wage labourers. The same\n",
      "alienation, the gradual increase and importance of trade, and the\n",
      "formation and introduction of capital, had formed a middle class\n",
      "of gentry, from which the successful merchant was not excluded.\n",
      "Nor had this political growth been unaccompanied by an advance of\n",

      "to have understood that a change in the character of the monarchy\n",
      "was inevitable, and that national unity could only be secured by\n",
      "upholding that change, placing the monarch in what may be regarded\n",

      "established a strict police, and suppressed disorder with a strong\n",
      "hand. Beyond that, the largest freedom was permitted. Thus, the\n",

      "Danes, which formed the civilized centre of the Scottish kingdom.\n",
      "But, when the supremacy of Wessex was thus secured, the Danes of\n",
      "the North were allowed to keep their own customs and make their\n",
      "own laws. Similarly, friendship with the Northmen of Ireland was\n",
      "maintained, and through their friendship the King was enabled\n",
      "to keep up a powerful fleet, which constantly sailed round the\n",

      "thrown much power into the hands of the Church, the most permanent\n",

      "Thus, the subdivisions of the Tribe were called Pagi, which seem\n",
      "to answer to the English Hundred. The Pagus was under the official\n",
      "chieftainship of an elective head called the Princeps, answering\n",
      "to the Saxon Ealdorman. This Pagus, which may perhaps have been\n",
      "originally a division of a hundred heads of families, supplied a\n",

      "or on some modification of it. The commanders in war, or Duces,\n",
      "were elected, probably from among the Principes, for each special\n",
      "occasion. It is, moreover, clear that private property had begun to\n",
      "exist. In pastoral life, where the common right of grazing would\n",
      "be the chief common privilege, there would be no difficulty in\n",
      "one man possessing more cattle than another. Neither would it be\n",
      "a great step to grant to such wealthier men, upon the redivision\n",
      "of the common arable mark, extra shares for the support of slaves\n",
      "or dependent freemen whom his wealth had attracted around him.\n",
      "There also existed a variety of ranks, which may be roughly\n",
      "divided into three classes,--the noble or _eorl_, who must have\n",
      "owed his nobility to birth; the freeman or _ceorl_, possessing his\n",
      "own homestead, his own share in the common land, and dependent\n",
      "on no man; and the _læt_ or dependent workman, cultivating his\n",
      "lord’s land. Besides these, there were actual slaves or _theows_,\n",
      "consisting of men who had lost their liberty either as captives,\n",
      "or for debt, or for some other easily conceivable causes. It does\n",
      "not appear that nobility of birth gave any additional political\n",
      "rights, although personal consideration was awarded to the noble.\n",
      "It was the possession of free land which made a man a full member\n",
      "of the tribe. The læts, however, were probably dependent only\n",
      "as regarded their lord, in every other respect free. Thus, like\n",
      "other members of the community, their death had to be atoned for\n",
      "by the payment of a sum of money or _weregild_, although the sum\n",
      "was smaller than in the case of freemen. They probably formed a\n",
      "considerable part of the armed force of the nation. The class may\n",
      "have consisted originally of a conquered population of kindred\n",
      "blood, or of men who voluntarily put themselves into a state of\n",
      "dependency upon their richer neighbours for security, or because\n",
      "for some reason they had become landless. Side by side with this\n",
      "democratic constitution, there was a peculiar institution known as\n",
      "the _Comitatus_. Each Princeps was allowed to collect around him,\n",
      "under a tie of personal dependence, a body of professed warriors,\n",
      "who were bound to him by the closest ties of honour; and the\n",
      "importance of each chief must have depended in a great degree upon\n",
      "this following. In case of conquest, it would naturally be the duty\n",
      "of the conquering chief to see to the welfare of his followers, and\n",
      "to give them grants, which might either be grants in perpetuity,\n",
      "or only the right of present possession, and which would be drawn\n",
      "from the conquered land remaining over after its distribution among\n",
      "the body of freemen. To cultivate these grants, the comrades of\n",
      "the king would have had to employ their own dependants, and these\n",
      "dependants would settle in villages, which took the form of village\n",
      "communities, except that the rights, which in the free communities\n",
      "would be vested in the whole body of the freemen, were in this case\n",
      "vested in the lord. We here have the germ of the relation between\n",
      "vassal and lord. But this element of feudalism soon acquired\n",
      "greater strength. The conquering chief would take upon himself\n",
      "the title of king, claim descent from the gods, and make his line\n",
      "hereditary. As the position of the king advanced, the position of\n",
      "the comrade or Gesith would advance also. As the king of a tribe\n",
      "became the king of a nation his dignity would greatly increase,\n",
      "and with his that of his followers, who, as the court became more\n",
      "formal, would accept as honours duties about the household, and the\n",
      "word _Gesith_, comrade, changed into _Thegn_ or servant. In times\n",
      "of war such nobles by service became natural leaders of the people,\n",
      "and the position of the chief men of the village proportionately\n",
      "sunk. So that there arose a class of nobles in immediate connection\n",
      "with the crown, possessing property not belonging to a village\n",
      "community, and exercising rights of lordship over its inhabitants.\n",
      "It is not difficult to see in what a superior position they were\n",
      "thus placed; what powers of encroachment they might have; and\n",
      "how willingly, in times of danger, village communities would put\n",
      "themselves in the same position with regard to them, as that\n",
      "occupied by those settlers on the Thegn’s lands, who had always\n",
      "acknowledged them as their lords. We have therefore two sources\n",
      "from which feudalism might have arisen; the village headman, in\n",
      "accordance with what seems to be a general law, as his powers came\n",
      "to be legally defined (especially in the matter of collecting the\n",
      "king’s taxes), would be regarded as the hereditary lord of the\n",
      "village, and would obtain the right of permanently enclosing his\n",
      "share of the common land; while the king’s Thegn, side by side with\n",
      "him, would plant his own subject villages, and accept by what is\n",

      "certain restrictions. It seems to have been regarded as necessary\n",

      "and fill up the vacant appointments. The most important of these\n",
      "was the archbishopric. For this post he selected Anselm of Aosta,\n",
      "Abbot of Bec. This man was a Piedmontese, who had been attracted to\n",
      "Normandy by the fame of Lanfranc, and had entered the Abbey of Bec\n",
      "under him. Upon Lanfranc’s removal to Caen he was made Prior, and\n",
      "afterwards Abbot. Both his character and attainments commanded the\n",
      "veneration of the age; and at the present time he had been invited\n",
      "by Hugh the Fat, Earl of Chester, to come over and assist him in\n",
      "establishing a Benedictine abbey at Chester. For this purpose, and\n",
      "charged with a mission from his monastery, he was induced much\n",
      "against his will to come to England. In the first access of the\n",
      "King’s repentance--after issuing a royal proclamation promising\n",
      "afresh the freedom of captives, the good laws of King Edward, and\n",
      "the punishment of evil-doers--he proceeded so far to action as to\n",
      "appoint Anselm Archbishop. It was not without something like actual\n",
      "violence that Anselm was forced to accept the Episcopal staff. The\n",
      "great importance of the primacy and Anselm’s view of the King’s\n",
      "character are well shown by some words that are attributed to him:\n",
      "“England’s plough is drawn by two supereminent oxen, the King and\n",
      "the Archbishop of Canterbury.... Of these oxen one is dead, and the\n",
      "other, fierce as a savage bull, is yoked young to the plough, and\n",
      "in place of the dead ox you would yoke me a poor feeble old sheep\n",

      "decided ecclesiastic. He insisted at once upon the restoration of\n",
      "the whole of the lands of the See of Canterbury, more even than\n",
      "Lanfranc had held. He declared that he would publicly acknowledge\n",

      "the King with £500 of silver, the King demanded £1000, he withdrew\n",
      "his intended present and distributed all to the poor. Nor was it\n",
      "as a defender of ecclesiastical rights that he was pre-eminent. He\n",
      "set himself to check as far as it was possible the shameless and\n",
      "abominable vice that was rampant in England. Among other signs of\n",
      "the degraded licentiousness of the times was the effeminate foppery\n",
      "of the courtiers. Against their long hair and sharp-peaked shoes\n",

      "from England put an end for a time to the disputes between the\n",

      "to obtain his pall from Pope Urban. This open acknowledgment of\n",
      "the Pope William wished to avoid, and at a council, summoned to\n",
      "consider the matter, the deposition of Anselm appears to have been\n",
      "suggested. The bishops, creatures of the King, basely deserted\n",
      "their chief; and the wisdom of the Baronage of England, under the\n",
      "guidance of Robert, Count of Mellent, who throughout this and the\n",

      "it from secular hands, and ultimately triumphed so far as to be\n",
      "allowed to take it himself from the high altar of the Cathedral of\n",
      "Canterbury. For the moment the primate was triumphant, the cowardly\n",

      "Under him was a selection of barons, the chief officers of the\n",

      "the exchequer chamber, and were spoken of as the barons of the\n",
      "exchequer. For general business they were called justices, and\n",
      "their head the chief-justice. The organization of this court dates\n",
      "from the reign of Henry I. The office of chief justiciary had been\n",

      "hands of whose family the direction of the machinery remained for\n",
      "nearly a century.[8] It was afterwards, as we shall see, brought\n",
      "to its completion by Henry II., but all its essential parts are\n",

      "naturally passed to questions of justice, and their connection\n",
      "with the local courts was further strengthened when Henry united\n",
      "several sheriffdoms under one of his justices. Following a natural\n",
      "tendency, the men employed for these offices were not the great\n",
      "barons, but new men, who rose by their talents, and were naturally\n",
      "upholders of the royal power and of order in opposition to the\n",

      "\n",
      "To sum up; after the year 1108, when the local courts were\n",
      "re-established, both the Hundred and county courts were the same in\n",
      "constitution and in arrangement as before the Conquest. But they\n",
      "were connected with the central government; because matters in\n",
      "which the King was interested were set aside for the consideration\n",
      "of the Curia Regis, or travelling justiciary sent out from that\n",
      "body; and because the Norman lawyers had introduced the practice of\n",
      "issuing writs from the King’s court, whereby the King, in virtue\n",
      "of what is called his “equitable power,” that is, his power of\n",
      "securing justice where the law did not give it, prescribed the\n",
      "method of action in certain difficult cases. The Hundred court\n",
      "was sometimes a lower court for the arrangement of small debts;\n",
      "the Bailiff of the Hundred then presided. Sometimes it was the\n",
      "great court held only twice a year; the sheriff then presided, the\n",
      "court exercised criminal jurisdiction, and was known as the “Court\n",
      "Leet.” It also saw to the filling up of the divisions of ten men\n",
      "required by the system of Frankpledge; this was called “the view of\n",
      "frankpledge.” The court was then known as “the Sheriff’s Tourn.”\n",
      "Below these local courts were the feudal manor courts, the old\n",

      "must not suppose that the authority of the sheriff and the local\n",
      "courts (now virtually royal courts) was universal. Certain great\n",

      "and in 1159 raised an army for the purpose. The war is interesting,\n",
      "not so much in itself, as in two or three collateral points\n",
      "connected with it. Thus Malcolm of Scotland came with forty-five\n",

      "of 700 men is mentioned. He is said to have urged the King to\n",
      "active measures against the French monarch. But Henry--who was\n",
      "surprised at finding his lately made friend in arms against him,\n",
      "and opposing with all his power a claim he had once himself urged,\n",
      "and who by no means wished to drive matters to extremity--showed\n",
      "some scruple in attacking his suzerain, and contented himself\n",
      "with gaining his object by laying waste the country and capturing\n",

      "Barcelona, the son-in-law of the King of Aragon,[21] and in fact\n",

      "changed for the fine usual in Kent, which was only forty shillings.\n",

      "inquiry, which was called for by the complaints of the exactions\n",

      "system of the country, the fruit of which was the concentration and\n",
      "organization of the Curia Regis, and the arrangements embodied in\n",

      "as has been already mentioned, of all those tenants who held\n",
      "their land direct from the crown (tenants _in capite_), and was\n",
      "the ordinary feudal court, and the natural parent of our present\n",
      "Parliament, and especially of the House of Lords. But for the\n",
      "ordinary despatch of business, whether judicial or financial,\n",
      "what may be regarded as a permanent committee of this body of\n",
      "immediate holders was employed. This committee consisted of the\n",
      "great officers of the household, such as the chancellor, treasurer,\n",
      "marshal and others, and other selected barons closely connected\n",
      "with the royal household. The head of this committee, or Curia\n",
      "Regis, was the great justiciary, the King’s representative. The\n",
      "royal chaplains or clerks were formed into a body of secretaries,\n",
      "at the head of which was the chancellor. The Curia Regis at first\n",
      "attended the King and had a twofold duty; when they sat as judges\n",
      "its members were called justices, in financial questions they\n",
      "sat in the exchequer[28] chamber, and were called barons. This\n",
      "administrative system, which had been organized in Henry I.’s\n",
      "reign, was entirely destroyed by the wild reign of Stephen. Its\n",
      "reconstitution was the great work of Henry II. In the earlier part\n",
      "of his reign the visitations were renewed upon the old system,\n",
      "the itinerant justice being usually either the great justiciary,\n",
      "chancellor, or some other great household officer. In the year\n",
      "1168 four barons of the exchequer performed this duty; in 1176\n",
      "the country was divided into six circuits. This number was not\n",
      "permanent, several alterations were made in it. Nor was the number\n",
      "of visitations thoroughly established. By Magna Charta in John’s\n",
      "reign commissions are promised four times a year, but shortly\n",
      "afterwards it would seem that the general journey of the itinerant\n",
      "justices was every seven years, until the reign of Edward I. It\n",
      "is to be remembered that these visitations were for all sorts\n",
      "of objects; for hearing civil cases, for inspecting the working\n",
      "of criminal jurisdiction, and, perhaps before all things, for\n",
      "arranging the financial matters of the country, and superintending\n",
      "the sheriffs in all matters connected with the exchequer. The\n",
      "itinerant justices during their circuits superseded the sheriff’s\n",
      "authority and presided in his courts. They were also allowed to\n",
      "enter and preside in the baronial courts. It has been mentioned\n",
      "that these courts were in most respects complete Hundreds. The two\n",
      "parallel systems, now on certain occasions presided over by the\n",
      "same official, were thus assimilated and brought into immediate\n",
      "connection with the central authority. This administrative\n",
      "organization gave rise to what is of much political importance, a\n",
      "new class of barons, new men who had risen by their talents and by\n",
      "the King’s favour, whose interests were therefore on the side of\n",
      "order and of the crown. At one period, in 1178, Henry II. appears\n",
      "to have found his new ministers untrustworthy, at all events in\n",
      "that year he restricted the Curia Regis to five persons, keeping\n",
      "the highest appellate jurisdiction in the hands of himself and the\n",
      "old Curia Regis, which may henceforth be regarded as the King’s\n",
      "_ordinary council_. The name Curia Regis has thus passed through\n",
      "three phases; a feudal court, a permanent committee of the feudal\n",
      "court, and a restricted committee of that committee. In these\n",
      "various bodies we have the sources of all the judicial bodies in\n",
      "England. The feudal court, with certain additions, became the\n",
      "Parliament; without those additions the Great Council, retaining\n",
      "its natural prerogative of final court of appeal, and represented\n",
      "now by the House of Lords. The permanent committee, or ordinary\n",
      "council, is represented by the privy council, still retaining\n",
      "some of its judicial powers. From its body of clerks, headed by\n",
      "the chancellor, arose the courts of Chancery. While the limited\n",

      "out inquiries of various kinds. As soon as such inquiries came to\n",
      "be made on oath, the beginning of the jury system had arrived.\n",
      "As early as the great Domesday survey, the sheriff, barons,\n",
      "freeholders, the priest, the reeve, and six villeins of each\n",
      "township, had been all examined upon oath. Judicially this method\n",
      "of inquiry was first applied in civil cases. By the ordinance of\n",
      "the Grand Assize, a choice was given to any person whose right to\n",
      "the possession of land was called in question. He might either\n",
      "if he pleased defend his claims by the old-fashioned appeal to\n",
      "battle, or he might have his right examined by twelve freeholders\n",
      "on their oath, selected by four freeholders also on their oath,\n",
      "nominated by the sheriff. These sworn freeholders were evidently\n",
      "at first witnesses; twelve others were subsequently added to them,\n",
      "who, from their neighbourhood or other reasons, might be supposed\n",
      "to be better acquainted with the facts. This took place in Edward\n",
      "I.’s reign. The double jury was then separated, the original twelve\n",
      "playing their part as jurors of the present day, judging of the\n",

      "It is scarcely possible to place the importance of this reign too\n",
      "high, or to overvalue the work of Henry II. We find in his reign\n",
      "the organization of almost all departments of the government\n",
      "subsequently completed by Edward I. The arrangements of the Curia\n",
      "Regis and the reforms in judicial procedure have been already\n",
      "mentioned. The exchequer also was put on a new footing. It now\n",
      "becomes possible to see with some clearness the sources and amount\n",
      "of the royal revenue. To the revenues derived from the domain lands\n",
      "and from the Danegelt, the Norman kings had added feudal dues. Both\n",
      "the proceeds of the royal domain and of the Danegelt appear to\n",
      "have been farmed. The farm of the counties amounted in Henry II.’s\n",
      "reign, after the deductions caused by the grants both of Stephen\n",
      "and of Henry, to about £8000 a year. The Danegelt, originally two\n",
      "shillings on every hide, amounted in Henry I.’s reign to about\n",
      "£2500. As this is about a tenth of what the tax would have produced\n",
      "had it been fully exacted, it must probably also have been farmed\n",
      "to the sheriff, who collected what he could of it, and paid a fixed\n",
      "sum to the exchequer. This unsatisfactory tax came to an end in\n",
      "Henry II.’s reign, perhaps through the agency of Becket. The other\n",
      "source of revenue was the _Donum_ and _Auxilium_, contributions\n",
      "paid by vassals to assist their lords. The first term applied to\n",
      "the counties, the second to the towns. These names became the\n",
      "general names of all irregular imposts, which are also sometimes\n",
      "called hidage, scutage, or tallage, the tallage being the aid\n",
      "raised from towns, the scutage the aid raised from knights’ fees,\n",
      "the hidage the aid raised from tenants in socage. The importance\n",
      "of the scutage as a commutation for military service has been\n",
      "already dwelt upon. Recourse appears to have been had to these\n",
      "scutages only three or four times during the reign. To these\n",
      "sources of revenue are to be added the fees from the law courts,\n",
      "and the incomes arising from feudal incidents, such as wardship,\n",
      "marriage, and reliefs. The whole income of the country was perhaps\n",
      "about £50,000. The taxes seem to have been assessed by Barons\n",
      "of the Exchequer, aided by the declaration of the knights as to\n",
      "their own holdings, by juries in the case of minor tenants. But it\n",
      "was not only in details of administration that Henry showed his\n",
      "character. He constantly summoned great councils, and as his power\n",
      "was so great and centralized that he could certainly have acted\n",
      "without them, this appears to show a fixed intention on his part\n",
      "to assume the position of a national and constitutional king. The\n",
      "general effect of his work at home was to form the nation. Normans\n",
      "became English. The English no longer felt themselves a conquered\n",
      "people. Their oppressors, the feudal nobility, were destroyed or\n",
      "kept in restraint. The new nobles were chiefly ministers of the\n",
      "crown, and all sections of the people looked to the King as the\n",
      "national representative. The importance of Henry’s reign abroad was\n",
      "scarcely less striking. His immense continental dominions made him\n",
      "one of the great powers of Europe. His close contact with France,\n",
      "and the difficulties which it produced, began the hereditary\n",
      "policy of opposition to that country which has characterized the\n",
      "whole of English history. On the other hand, though he may have\n",
      "had no clear view of what he was doing, he set on foot also the\n",
      "lasting friendships of the nation. The marriage of his daughter\n",
      "with the Guelph Duke brought England into constant friendship\n",
      "with Germany, and caused Otho, the son of Henry the Lion, to be\n",
      "brought up in England, and to be regarded as an English prince.\n",
      "The marriage of his other daughter with Spain set on foot that\n",
      "connection which lasted even beyond the Reformation. His work as a\n",
      "whole may be summed up in the words of Professor Stubbs: “He was\n",
      "faithful to the letter of his engagements. He recovered the demesne\n",
      "rights of the crown, so that his royal dignity did not depend\n",
      "for maintenance on constant taxation. He restored the usurped\n",
      "estates; he destroyed the illegal castles, and the system which\n",
      "they typified; he maintained the royal hold on the lawful ones,\n",
      "and the equality and uniformity of justice which their usurpers\n",
      "had subverted; he restored internal peace, and with it plenty,\n",
      "as the riches of England in the following reign amply testify.\n",
      "He arranged the administration of justice by enacting good laws\n",
      "and appointing faithful judges. He restored the currency; he\n",
      "encouraged commerce, he maintained the privileges of the towns;\n",
      "and, without encouraging an aggressive spirit, armed his people for\n",
      "self-defence. He sustained the form, and somewhat of the spirit\n",
      "of national representation. The clergy had grounds of complaint\n",
      "against him for very important reasons; but their chief complaints\n",
      "were caused by their preference for the immunities of their class\n",

      "of the Earl of Pembroke. Their strength consisted of the nobles of\n",
      "the North--and they were spoken of as the Northerners,--but many\n",
      "barons from other parts of England joined them, and in spite of\n",

      "received in May; and thus masters of the greater part of England,\n",
      "and of the capital, they compelled John to receive them and hear\n",
      "their demands at Runnymede, a meadow by the Thames’ side not far\n",
      "from Staines. There was signed, on the 15th of June, the paper\n",
      "of forty-nine articles, which they presented, and which were\n",

      "That Great Charter was the joint work of the insurgent lords,\n",

      "In many points this rising of the barons bears the appearance of\n",
      "an ordinary feudal insurrection. Closer examination proves that\n",
      "it was of a different character. The very success of Henry II in\n",
      "his great plan of national regeneration had tended to change the\n",
      "character of English politics. Till his time, the bulk of the\n",
      "people had regarded the crown on the whole as a defence against\n",
      "their feudal tyrants. In the pursuit of good government he had\n",
      "crushed the feudal nobles, and had welded Norman and English into\n",
      "one nation. In so doing, he had greatly increased the royal power;\n",
      "for in those early times good government invariably implied a\n",
      "strong monarchy. In patriotic hands his work might have continued.\n",
      "But when the increased royal power passed to reckless rulers, such\n",
      "as Richard and John, it enabled them to play the part of veritable\n",
      "tyrants. They had used this power in ruthlessly pillaging the\n",
      "people. The great justiciaries, Hubert and Fitz-Peter, content with\n",
      "keeping order and retaining constitutional forms, had almost of\n",
      "necessity lent themselves to this course, while lesser officials\n",
      "had undoubtedly acted with arbitrary violence. The interests of the\n",
      "King and his ministers had thus become separated from those of the\n",
      "nation. To oppose this tyranny, nobles and people could now act in\n",
      "concert. The struggle was no longer between King and people on one\n",
      "side against the nobles on the other, but nobles and people had\n",
      "joined against the King. Besides this political change, a great\n",
      "revolution had taken place in the character of the nobility itself.\n",
      "The feudal nobles, the friends of the Conqueror, had for the most\n",
      "part given place to a new nobility, the sons of the counsellors\n",
      "and ministers of Henry II. In the centre of England alone did\n",
      "remnants of the old feudal families remain. The insurrection then,\n",
      "coming from the North, was the work not of feudal barons but of\n",
      "the new ministerial baronage. Again, the claims raised, although,\n",
      "inasmuch as the monarchy was still in form a feudal monarchy, they\n",
      "bear a resemblance to feudal claims, were such as might have been\n",
      "expected from men trained in the habits of administration. They\n",
      "were claims for the redress of abuses of constitutional power, and\n",
      "were based upon a written document. In addition to this, they were\n",
      "supported by the clergy, who were never and could never be feudal\n",
      "in their views, and by the towns, whose interests were always\n",
      "opposed to those of the feudal nobility. There is another thing to\n",
      "be recollected; the Charter, as ultimately granted, was not the\n",
      "same as the demands of the barons. A considerable number of the\n",
      "older barons, of the bishops, and even the Archbishop himself,\n",
      "remained ostensibly true to the King, and were present at Runnymede\n",
      "as his followers. We are told that it was the younger nobles who\n",
      "formed the strength of the reforming party. Nevertheless, with the\n",
      "exception of the King’s actual ministers, and of those foreigners,\n",
      "the introduction of whom was one of his gravest errors, the whole\n",
      "of John’s own following acknowledged the justice of the baronial\n",
      "claims, sympathized with the demands raised, and joined in putting\n",
      "them into the best shape. The movement was in fact, even where not\n",

      "matters of wardship, of heirship, widowhood, and marriage (2-8).\n",
      "Scutage and aids, which John had from the beginning of his reign\n",
      "taken as a matter of course, were henceforward to be granted by\n",

      "counts and greater barons, summoned severally by writ, and of\n",
      "the rest of the tenants in chief, summoned by general writ to\n",
      "the sheriff (14). The lands of sub-tenants, seized by the king\n",
      "for treason or felony, were to be held by him for a year only,\n",

      "The mere narration of the political facts of the reign, although\n",

      "idea of the real constitutional importance of his work. Not only\n",
      "was he the first truly English King, both by his circumstances\n",
      "and political views, but he became, in virtue of his love of order\n",
      "and legal arrangement, the completer of the English Constitution.\n",
      "In the first place, it is to him that we owe the perfection of\n",
      "the Parliamentary system, of the complete representation in\n",
      "Parliament of the three Estates of the realm, the Lords, Commons,\n",
      "and Clergy. For it is plain that it was his intention to combine\n",
      "the three, although the clergy refused to accede to his wish, and\n",
      "preferred to tax themselves separately in Convocation; a body which\n",
      "however, as will be afterwards seen, also owes its representative\n",
      "arrangements to him. The gradual introduction of the representative\n",
      "system of the counties has been mentioned. Again and again, on\n",
      "special occasions, knights, to represent the shire and to give\n",
      "information with regard to their counties, had been summoned. Simon\n",
      "de Montfort had even introduced representation of the boroughs; but\n",
      "this was regarded as wholly exceptional. Nevertheless, Edward was\n",
      "not long in seeing both the justice and advantage of the system.\n",
      "In the first Parliament of his reign, when enacting the first\n",
      "great Statute of Westminster, a healing and restorative measure\n",
      "applicable to the whole country, he said that he made it with the\n",
      "consent of the _commonalty_; there were possibly representatives of\n",
      "the counties present; more probably their consent was arrived at\n",
      "in some other way. At the same time, the high view which he took\n",
      "of his own constitutional position is marked by a change in the\n",
      "ordinary form of enactment. Statutes had hitherto been enacted “by\n",
      "the counsel and consent of Parliament.” The alteration of a few\n",
      "letters changed the meaning of this phrase. The present statute was\n",
      "said to be enacted “by the King by the advice of his Council and\n",
      "the assent of Parliament.” The legislative power was thus made to\n",
      "reside in the King and his Council. It is the power thus claimed\n",
      "which gave rise to the legislative, or rather the ordaining power\n",
      "claimed by the King in Council, which was afterwards frequently\n",
      "complained of by the Parliament. But Edward, in spite of these\n",
      "pretensions, accepted the view that all should be consulted where\n",
      "the interests of all were at stake. This was of course chiefly\n",
      "in the matter of taxation, and the convenience as well as the\n",
      "justice of the method which Simon de Montfort had set on foot soon\n",
      "became evident to his mind. From the beginning of this reign, the\n",
      "method of taxation had been changed. Instead of an aid, raised\n",
      "from the land, it had become a subsidy raised by an assessment\n",
      "on the moveables of the people. Most frequently the proportion\n",
      "granted was a tenth or fifteenth, but in these early times every\n",
      "variety of proportion was granted. As yet, however, these taxes\n",
      "had been collected locally in accordance with arrangements made\n",
      "by Exchequer officers, sheriffs, or the county court. In 1282,\n",
      "the King, being in want of money for his Welsh wars, proceeded by\n",
      "his ordinary method. The sums raised locally were insufficient;\n",
      "while his Barons were with him at the wars it was inconvenient to\n",
      "hold a Parliament; writs were issued therefore to the sheriffs\n",
      "and archbishops to collect their two Estates, the Commons and the\n",
      "clergy, at two centres, York and Northampton. At these meetings\n",
      "were present four representative knights from each county, and\n",
      "all freeholders of more than one knight’s fee. The Commons made\n",
      "their grant of a thirtieth. The assemblies of the clergy declined,\n",
      "until the parochial clergy were represented. For this purpose the\n",
      "election of Proctors was then ordered, and they have since formed\n",
      "a regular part of the Convocation. These negotiations were not\n",
      "completed when what is called the Parliament of Acton Burnell was\n",
      "summoned to settle the affairs of Wales. At that meeting there\n",
      "were present no clergy, and representatives of twenty towns only,\n",
      "summoned separately. In 1290, a further proof is given that for\n",
      "taxation by subsidy the representation of the Commons was beginning\n",
      "to be considered necessary. In that year an old-fashioned feudal\n",
      "aid was granted for the marriage of the King’s daughter. It was\n",
      "granted by the baronage for the whole commonalty, and was in the\n",
      "old form of land-tax, but the Commons being subsequently present,\n",
      "it was changed at their request to a fifteenth. It was possible for\n",
      "the baronage to grant the aid upon military tenants, but the rest\n",
      "of the people could not be reached. Two principles had by this time\n",
      "been established,--that the clergy should be fully represented, and\n",
      "that for subsidies upon the whole kingdom it was both convenient\n",
      "and just that the Commons should in some way be represented; but\n",
      "it was not yet held necessary for feudal matters, or for questions\n",
      "touching the baronage only, that the Commons should be present.\n",
      "Indeed, at this very Parliament, the statute “Quia Emptores” was\n",
      "passed by the Barons before the Commons assembled. All these\n",
      "preparatory steps found their completion in the Parliament of 1295,\n",
      "when writs were issued to the Archbishops to appear themselves, and\n",
      "to send Proctors to Westminster; to the Prelates and Barons, as\n",
      "Peers, and to the sheriffs, summoning the knights of the counties,\n",
      "and two burghers from each town.[53] There was thus a Parliament\n",
      "complete in all its parts, such as it has since remained. We must\n",
      "not suppose, however, that the Estates acted in common, or that\n",
      "the Commons had much voice in the deliberation. At this very\n",
      "Parliament of 1295, the grant of each order was different, nor\n",
      "was it till 1318, in Edward II.’s reign, that the Commons can be\n",
      "considered as perfectly incorporated in the Legislative Assembly.\n",
      "The constitutional view at present was, that the King, with the\n",
      "assent of his Barons, granted the petitions of the Commons and the\n",
      "Clergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Sidenote: Great statutes of the reign.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The great statutes which were passed in these various Parliaments\n",
      "must now be mentioned. Those which were of most general national\n",
      "interest were the First Statute of Westminster, which, as has been\n",
      "before said, revived and re-established the old constitutions of\n",
      "the country, and limited the employment of feudal aids; and the\n",
      "Statute of Winchester, passed in 1285, which was a re-enactment\n",
      "and completion of the Assize of Arms established by Henry II., and\n",
      "aimed at once at the defence and police of the country. It laid\n",
      "upon the counties, under heavy penalties, the duty of indicting\n",
      "felons and robbers, ordered the police arrangements of walled\n",
      "towns, the enlargement and clearing of the edges of public roads,\n",
      "and further defined the arms which each class of the population\n",
      "was bound to procure for the preservation of the land. Constables\n",
      "and justices were to be appointed to see to the proper observance\n",
      "of this statute, from whom subsequently grew the justices of the\n",
      "peace. Some such statute was indeed very necessary, and even its\n",
      "stringent provisions were not sufficient to establish order. In\n",
      "1305, England was full of riotous outlaws, who were willing to\n",
      "hire themselves out for purposes of private outrage when they were\n",
      "not plying their own trade of robbery; these were known by the\n",
      "name of “trail-bâtons.” To suppress them it was found necessary to\n",
      "issue commissions to travelling justices, empowering them to act\n",
      "summarily towards such breakers of the peace. Their strictness is\n",
      "mentioned in the political songs of the day. It was impossible,\n",
      "it was said, any longer to beat your children, you were at once\n",
      "punished as a trail-bâton.[54] Even the stringency of these\n",
      "measures of suppression mark Edward’s love of order. Lastly, must\n",
      "be mentioned the great Acts for the confirmation of the charters,\n",
      "which are sometimes regarded as the statute “De tallagio non\n",
      "concedendo.” From this time forward arbitrary tallages, though\n",
      "occasionally used, began to be regarded as illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also two great statutes bearing almost entirely upon the\n",
      "feudal relations of landed proprietors. The first was the statute\n",
      "of “Quia Emptores” (1290), which forbad subinfeudation and the\n",
      "formation of new manors. Its original object was to prevent feudal\n",
      "lords from being defrauded of their dues. Henceforward, property\n",
      "alienated ceased to belong in any sense to the subordinate grantor,\n",
      "and returned to the property of the lord superior of the whole\n",
      "estate. The effect, unforeseen by the enacters, was to increase the\n",
      "number of independent gentry holding immediately from the crown or\n",
      "from the great lords. The second statute is known by the name of\n",
      "the Second Statute of Westminster, or “De donis conditionalibus.”\n",
      "When an estate had been given to a man and to his children, it had\n",
      "hitherto been held sufficient that the child should be born. The\n",
      "estate had then become the absolute property of the man to whom it\n",
      "had been granted, and he could alienate it at his will. It was now\n",
      "enacted that he had but a life interest in it, that if his children\n",
      "were not living at his death, it reverted to the original grantor.\n",
      "Thus was established the power of entail. There remains one great\n",
      "statute to be mentioned, the Statute of Mortmain. This was aimed\n",
      "against the increasing power and wealth of the Church, and against\n",
      "a legal trick by which laymen had freed themselves from feudal\n",
      "liabilities. It had become a custom to give property to the Church\n",
      "and to receive it back as tenant of the Church, thus freed from\n",
      "obligation to lay superiors. At the same time, even though this\n",
      "device was not used, the accumulation of property in the hands of\n",
      "the Church withdrew it from many feudal duties. It passed, it was\n",
      "said, “in mortuam manum”--into a dead hand. All transactions by\n",
      "which lands or tenements could in any way pass into mortmain were\n",
      "now forbidden. The same spirit which produced these laws had been\n",
      "felt in the administration of justice, where the three courts of\n",
      "Exchequer, King’s Bench and Common Pleas were finally separated,\n",
      "and each provided with a full staff of officials. Even from this\n",

      "the baronial party agreed to repair to those parts of England where\n",
      "they had most influence. Lancaster proceeded northwards so rapidly,\n",
      "that the King had to fly before him, and was nearly captured at\n",
      "Newcastle, where Gaveston’s jewels and horses fell into Lancaster’s\n",
      "hands, and thence he took ship for Scarborough. Lancaster took\n",
      "up his position in the middle of England, while the rest of the\n",
      "baronial party besieged Gaveston in that fortress, where he was\n",
      "soon obliged to surrender. This he did to the Earl of Pembroke,\n",
      "who was no enemy to the King, upon a promise that if he could not\n",
      "come to terms with the Barons he should be restored to Scarborough.\n",
      "Pembroke persuaded him to go with him to his castle at Wallingford,\n",
      "but on the way, during a temporary absence of Pembroke, he was\n",
      "surprised by Warwick, who hated him for having nicknamed him “The\n",
      "Black Dog,” brought to his castle of Warwick, and there beheaded on\n",
      "Blacklow Hill. The King was naturally full of anger, nor did he, in\n",
      "fact, ever forgive Lancaster, but he yielded to necessity, being\n",
      "perhaps in a particularly good humour at the birth of a son and\n",
      "heir; and the Barons, who appeared in arms at Ware, all received\n",
      "pardon in exchange for some slight concessions, among others for\n",
      "the restoration of Gaveston’s jewels. It was not, however, till the\n",

      "east of the castle, with his right resting on the little brook\n",

      "partly covered by a marsh, and where this ceased and waste land\n",
      "began he had dug shallow pitfalls, with a pointed stake in each,\n",
      "to check the advance of the heavy cavalry, of which the English\n",
      "army then consisted. His left was defended by the cliffs of the\n",
      "castle. Edward Bruce commanded the right, Thomas Randolf the left,\n",
      "Walter Stewart and James Douglas the centre, a small rearguard was\n",
      "commanded by Bruce himself. On the eve of St. John’s the English\n",
      "attempted to secure Stirling, but were beaten back by Randolf. On\n",
      "the morning of the 24th of June, the Abbot of Inchaffray said mass\n",

      "beg pardon.” But Ingram of Umfranville, a Scotch nobleman, by his\n",

      "were the camp followers of Bruce’s army, who were eagerly pushing\n",
      "forward to watch the fight, but the English believed it was the\n",
      "arrival of reinforcements. They had already found enough to do, and\n",
      "did not wait the new arrivals. The flight soon became a disorderly\n",

      "To understand the politics of this time, we have to rid ourselves\n",
      "of both the names and ideas of the present day. The lines which\n",
      "divided classes were much more distinctly marked. Political life\n",
      "was confined entirely to the upper ranks. The House of Commons,\n",
      "which we are in the habit of regarding as a popular assembly,\n",
      "and which was, in fact, the most popular assembly of that time,\n",
      "was in part entirely aristocratic, in part representative of the\n",
      "moneyed interests of the country. Below this no class could make\n",
      "its voice heard at all, and this moneyed and aristocratic House\n",
      "of Commons was only beginning by slow degrees to force itself\n",
      "into political power. It had, in fact, consisted at first of two\n",
      "separate orders,--the knights of the shire, who represented the\n",
      "lesser nobility, and the burgesses. The knights had naturally\n",
      "joined without difficulty in the deliberations of a baronage who\n",
      "were socially their equals; the burgesses had busied themselves\n",
      "almost exclusively with financial questions touching their own\n",
      "order. Various causes had gradually tended to draw the two lower\n",
      "orders together, and by the beginning of the reign of Edward III.,\n",
      "the division of Parliament into two Houses, of which the lower\n",
      "consisted of knights and burgesses, had been completed. Indeed,\n",
      "the Act of 1321, passed when Edward II. was victorious over the\n",
      "barons, had acknowledged the claims of the burgesses to share in\n",
      "the proceedings of Parliament. The practical government of the\n",
      "country had hitherto been in the hands of the House of Lords.\n",
      "There were thus three distinct classes, the baronage, the upper\n",
      "or represented commonalty, consisting of knights and burgesses,\n",
      "and the lower commonalty. Power was as yet in the hands of the\n",
      "baronage. When, therefore, no common cause was driving the baronage\n",
      "to united action, as among all governing classes, there was certain\n",
      "to be a difference of view, and the baronage would be divided\n",
      "into parties. On the other hand, the upper Commons, just forcing\n",
      "their way upwards, were inclined to be sometimes subservient to\n",
      "the wishes of the Barons, sometimes ready to join that one of the\n",
      "baronial parties which seemed to give them the greatest promise\n",
      "of political assistance. The lower, or unrepresented Commons,\n",
      "unable to make themselves heard, had been of no political account;\n",
      "although a series of events had lately contributed to put them in\n",
      "such a position that their friendship was worth having, and to\n",
      "enable them soon to speak with arms in their hands, in a way which\n",
      "was very terrible. Each of these classes had its own particular\n",
      "interests, and made their combinations with the other classes to\n",
      "suit the advance of those interests. The Barons desired power, the\n",
      "higher Commons good administration, especially of the finances;\n",
      "the lower Commons such improvements in their position as they\n",
      "afterwards claimed under Wat Tyler. Hitherto, in the main, the\n",
      "interest of the baronage had been the restriction within fixed\n",
      "limits of the royal authority; they had hitherto been the guardians\n",
      "of the constitutional growth of the country, and their rebellions\n",
      "and opposition, whatever selfish leaven may have been mixed with\n",
      "them, deserve to be regarded as efforts towards popular liberty.\n",
      "About the period which we have now reached, this guardianship\n",
      "of the Constitution passed into the hands of the upper Commons.\n",
      "The Barons themselves having now acquired a preponderance in the\n",
      "government, it was their encroachments rather than the King’s which\n",
      "had to be guarded against. In principle, the safeguards of the\n",
      "Constitution had been established by Edward I., and were therefore\n",
      "no longer the subject of contention. The baronage was no longer\n",
      "interested to secure power, but to enjoy a power already secured.\n",
      "They thus fell into parties whose real object was to appropriate\n",
      "that power. For that purpose, like other political parties, the\n",
      "rival Barons would seek to attach to themselves any of the other\n",
      "sections of society, and would therefore adopt those principles and\n",
      "those party cries which seemed to promise them the most success. It\n",
      "becomes, therefore, impossible to say that this or that baronial\n",
      "insurrection was popular or constitutional. For their own objects,\n",
      "the most disorderly Barons might attach themselves to the Commons,\n",
      "to the lower classes, or to the King. Their divisions had, in fact,\n",
      "become party struggles for power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the chief questions at that time exciting England were the\n",
      "position of the Church, the continuation of the war with France,\n",

      "the baronage might form itself into parties, which might seek\n",
      "their own advantage by adopting the interests of other sections\n",
      "of society. It is in this way that must be explained the apparent\n",
      "contradictions in the conduct of the Parliament at the close of\n",
      "Edward’s reign. For many years there had been growing a strong\n",
      "dislike to the Church in England. The oppressions of the Popes,\n",
      "the selfish character of their government at Avignon, the loss of\n",
      "spirituality on the part of the higher clergy, from whose ranks the\n",
      "statesmen of the time were largely drawn, and the deterioration of\n",
      "the mendicant orders, together with the idea always prevalent in\n",
      "England of the supremacy of the state, had given birth to a party\n",
      "who desired the pre-eminence in all matters of the laity,--a party\n",
      "which is of course connected with the doctrinal views at this time\n",
      "brought forward by Wicliffe. The existence of this lay party is\n",
      "clearly shown by the proceedings of the year 1340, when for the\n",
      "first time a lay Chancellor, Sir Robert Bouchier, was appointed\n",
      "in the place of Stratford. When the baronage were divided, the\n",
      "natural leaders of the parties were the royal princes. Thus, when\n",
      "circumstances had put the reins of power into the hands of John\n",
      "of Gaunt, he fortified himself by assuming the leadership of the\n",
      "lay party, which found its adherents in all sections of society,\n",
      "but no doubt mainly among the barons, jealous of the great part\n",
      "played in the government by the clergy, the vast wealth which the\n",
      "Church held, and which is calculated at more than a third of the\n",

      "William of Wykeham, had surrendered the great seal, which, together\n",

      "there is little doubt that the ecclesiastics he had displaced\n",
      "were far better governors than the partisans he had put in their\n",

      "was the Black Prince, a party consisting of those who preferred\n",
      "the old system of government, and which included the higher clergy\n",
      "and the financial reformers. It has been pointed out that the\n",
      "disastrous government of John of Gaunt had found its partisans\n",
      "chiefly among the Barons. On the whole, therefore, the Commons\n",
      "attached themselves to the party of the Black Prince. For the\n",
      "time a restoration of good government and well-managed finance\n",
      "seemed to them of more importance than the overthrow of the\n",
      "Church, especially as their interests as a class seemed to lead\n",
      "in the same direction. The struggle came to an issue in the Good\n",
      "Parliament, which met in April 1376. The Commons presented a\n",
      "remonstrance, which, after enumerating their financial grievances,\n",
      "and asserting the mismanagement of the Government, demanded a\n",
      "change in the council; in other words, a change of ministry. The\n",
      "clergy, and William of Wykeham among them, again came into office.\n",
      "They were not content with this, but impeached--and this is the\n",
      "first instance of parliamentary impeachment--Lord Latimer, the\n",
      "Chamberlain. A considerable number of the other officers were\n",
      "arrested and thrown into prison, and Alice Perrers was forbidden\n",
      "to use her influence under pain of banishment. They were still\n",
      "discussing further reforms, when the death of the Black Prince\n",
      "deprived them of their chief support. Afraid that John of Gaunt had\n",
      "views on the succession, they insisted on the immediate recognition\n",
      "of the Black Prince’s son; and a deputation waited on the old King\n",
      "at Eltham to receive an answer to their complaints and petitions.\n",
      "These, as might be expected, were chiefly directed against the\n",
      "encroachments of the Papacy, in hatred to which all parties in\n",
      "England joined. Still the King’s reply shows the influence of the\n",
      "newly restored clerical counsellors. Enough, he said, had been done\n",

      "of the feudal and ecclesiastical system of the middle ages, and\n",
      "the introduction, as political and social elements of weight, of\n",
      "the middle and industrial classes. It is the beginning of that\n",
      "process which constitutes therefore the history of this period. The\n",
      "points to observe will be, therefore, the growth and advance of\n",
      "the commons, the decay of the aristocracy. But it is as yet quite\n",

      "and which was already becoming of political importance, from the\n",

      "and the characteristics, the employments, and the feelings of the\n",

      "Trade, on which their riches depended, was as yet in its infancy;\n",
      "and the views which regulated its management as yet too crude to be\n",
      "spoken of by such a dignified title as political economy. As far as\n",
      "they went, however, they were very clear, and were, in fact, though\n",

      "England before the time of Adam Smith. Observing only the obvious\n",
      "fact, that the possession of money enabled a man to purchase\n",
      "whatever he wanted, early traders conceived the idea that money\n",
      "was wealth, and that nothing else was. And as the wealth of the\n",
      "nation was of the last importance, both to the governor and to the\n",
      "governed, and as trade was the chief method by which money could\n",
      "be supplied, and by which money might be drawn from the country,\n",
      "the regulation of trade became one of the most important duties of\n",
      "the King and the Parliament. Now money being the sole wealth, in\n",
      "that regulation of trade it became necessary to aim first at the\n",
      "introduction of money; secondly, at its retention. It was to these\n",
      "objects that the frequent ordinances and statutes with regard to\n",
      "trade were directed. Although very various and, as such regulations\n",
      "were almost certain to be, frequently inefficacious, they were\n",
      "energetic and simple. England was not as yet a manufacturing\n",
      "country. Its trade was an export trade of raw materials,\n",
      "principally derived from sheep farming on the vast spaces of\n",
      "uncultivated land which then existed, and from its mineral wealth.\n",
      "Its principal commodities were wool, sheep-skins, or wool-fells,\n",
      "and leather, together with tin and lead.[70] Only the coarsest\n",
      "kind of cloth was manufactured; sometimes intentionally rough and\n",
      "coarse, to be changed into fine cloth afterwards in Flanders, but\n",
      "exported as cloth to avoid the tax on wool. Primitive trade, when\n",
      "the seas were beset with pirates, had been carried on chiefly\n",
      "inland, and great fairs, such as that of Troyes in France, had been\n",
      "established under the guardianship of feudal lords, who guaranteed\n",
      "the safety of the merchants for a toll. Domestic trade was carried\n",
      "on in the same way, and one of the forms of royal exaction was to\n",
      "open a fair, and insist upon all other shops and other places of\n",
      "sale being closed during its continuance.[71] As the seas became\n",
      "safer, and the mercantile spirit of the Flemings rose, the great\n",
      "free cities of Flanders became as it were perpetual fairs, and were\n",
      "known as staples, from the German “stapeln,” _to keep up_. In order\n",
      "that trade should be well under command, it was necessary that it\n",
      "should be carried on in few channels. The English government had\n",
      "therefore chosen some of these Flemish towns, and ordered that\n",
      "all the chief productions of England, which have been already\n",
      "mentioned, should be sold in those towns, and nowhere else. These\n",
      "goods were therefore called staple commodities; the merchants who\n",
      "traded in them, the merchants of the staple. And this staple trade\n",
      "was put under an organization--there being a mayor, a constable,\n",
      "and courts of the staple. At these staple towns, the King’s\n",
      "customers, or custom-house officers, by means of this organization,\n",
      "had every bargain under direct supervision; and every bargain thus\n",
      "supervised was obliged to be made for a certain sum of actual coin,\n",
      "the government thus securing a continual flow of silver into the\n",
      "hands of the English merchants. The staple towns were frequently\n",
      "changed. To reward any particularly faithful ally, or to raise the\n",
      "importance of any particular town, as for instance Calais, the\n",
      "staple was removed to that Prince’s province, or to that town. The\n",
      "proportion of each bargain to be brought over in coin was also\n",
      "constantly varying. Indeed, the frequent interference of government\n",
      "in such matters was not among the least of the restrictions of\n",
      "trade. Edward III. was said, at one time of his life, to have had a\n",
      "different plan every month. Upon the whole, however, the principle\n",
      "was the same. Amongst the most remarkable plans of Edward III. was\n",
      "one for keeping the evident riches that accrued to the staple towns\n",
      "within the limits of England. In the twenty-seventh year of his\n",
      "reign he named nine towns in England which were to be the exclusive\n",
      "selling places of the English staple commodities. For an Englishman\n",
      "to carry such commodities beyond the seas was punishable by death.\n",
      "As Edward could not protect the foreign merchants visiting his\n",
      "staples, and as the additional trouble of purchasing goods at them\n",
      "naturally lowered prices, this plan did not answer. It was, in\n",
      "fact, suicidal for an island people, since it destroyed all object\n",
      "in the keeping up a mercantile navy. It was therefore speedily\n",
      "abandoned; and after the reign of Henry VI., Calais became the sole\n",
      "English staple town. A similar attempt was made in the fourteenth\n",
      "year of Richard II., when it was enacted that no Englishman\n",
      "should buy wool except of the owners of the sheep, and for his own\n",
      "use. The export trade was thus again for a time given over to the\n",
      "foreign merchant, for the sake of securing to the wool-grower the\n",
      "profits of the retail as well as the wholesale trade; the effect\n",
      "was naturally a decrease of purchasers, which reduced the growers\n",
      "to great distress. The government had, by insisting on money\n",
      "payments in every bargain, secured an influx of silver; but as the\n",
      "nation was too far advanced in civilization to do without foreign\n",
      "products, there were a certain number of foreign importers, who\n",
      "threatened in their turn to withdraw it again. One or two attempts\n",
      "were indeed made to confine English trade to the limits of the\n",
      "country. Thus, it was the view of Simon de Montfort, who disliked\n",
      "all extravagance in dress, that the production of the country was\n",
      "enough to supply its own inhabitants; and in 1261, and in 1271,\n",
      "exportation of English wool was forbidden, and people acquired the\n",
      "habit of dressing in undyed native cloth. Such primitive patriotism\n",
      "could not last in an advancing nation. Trade soon resumed its old\n",
      "course. The greater part of the foreign merchants were Germans, and\n",
      "to keep them under government supervision, they were formed into a\n",
      "guild, given certain privileges, allowed to possess a guild-hall,\n",
      "and are generally known as the Merchants of the Steelyard.[72]\n",
      "Other alien merchants there also were, who were protected by law;\n",
      "notably by the great statute of Edward I., “De mercatoribus.” But\n",
      "although the goods they brought were necessary, their bargains, no\n",
      "less than those of the staple merchants, were under supervision.\n",
      "They were bound to employ a certain proportion of the money\n",
      "obtained from their sales in English goods.[73] Moreover, all\n",
      "foreign merchants were held to be mutually responsible for each\n",
      "other’s debts. Thus the retention of the silver in England was\n",
      "also secured, while, to avoid any varieties in the value of money,\n",
      "English coin alone was current, and foreign coin had at once to be\n",
      "exchanged at the royal exchangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Sidenote: Coinage.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Since money was so important an object, the coinage was naturally\n",
      "regarded with great care. It was an exclusive royal monopoly, and\n",
      "in the reign of Edward III. the punishment of death was enacted\n",
      "against false coiners. There was a constant dread lest in the\n",
      "exchange England should be the loser. The belief was prevalent that\n",
      "the value of the money depended upon the denomination. It had not\n",
      "yet entered men’s minds to think that it was but another commodity,\n",
      "worth exactly its intrinsic value, which no change of name could\n",
      "alter. Up till the reign of Edward III., although clipped and\n",
      "lightened in use, and although Edward I. had begun the bad practice\n",
      "of depreciating the coin by diminishing its legal weight, the\n",
      "coinage had been on the whole but little tampered with. But between\n",
      "the years 1344 and 1351, the number of silver pennies made from the\n",
      "pound of silver had increased from 243 to 270. In that year, groats\n",
      "of the nominal value of 4d., but of the weight of only three and\n",
      "a half of the diminished penny, were issued. It is impossible to\n",
      "make any true estimate of the comparative value of money then and\n",
      "at the present time. The facts with regard to the actual amount of\n",
      "silver employed are these: The pound, which only nominally existed,\n",
      "was a full pound of silver, which would at present be coined into\n",
      "£2, 16s. 3d. The shilling, which seems also to have been a nominal\n",
      "coin, was the twentieth part of this, or 2s. 9¾d. The silver penny,\n",
      "which was, till the time of Edward III., almost the only coin, was\n",
      "therefore worth 2¾d. Edward introduced several new coins; some of\n",
      "gold, which, as there was no fixed proportion between them and\n",
      "silver, were not popular, and were recalled; and nobles of the\n",
      "value of 6s. 8d., or half a mark; together with the groats above\n",
      "mentioned. But of the purchasing value of the money thus made\n",
      "no fixed estimate can be given, as that of course depends upon\n",
      "the relative value of the articles purchased; and under the very\n",
      "different circumstances of those times the relative value of those\n",
      "articles was so different, that to compare the value of money with\n",
      "any one of them would give a totally false impression. It is usual\n",
      "to say roughly that to reach the present value of any sum mentioned\n",
      "it should be multiplied by fifteen.\n",

      "This form of commerce, restricted as has been before explained, was\n",
      "certain to break down as the wants of the nation increased. There\n",
      "was a company of merchant adventurers founded, perhaps, though this\n",
      "seems very uncertain, as early as Henry III.’s reign, which had\n",
      "the right to trade in other commodities besides the staple, and\n",
      "to choose its own ports. It was the growth of this company which,\n",
      "in the next century, had most to do with breaking down the staple\n",
      "monopoly. It is needless to point out the bad effects which this\n",
      "constant interference must have produced. It is certain that the\n",
      "foreign merchant paid himself well for the extreme difficulties\n",
      "placed in the way of his business; while, at the same time, the\n",
      "difficulties of procuring foreign articles of luxury must have\n",
      "gone far to render the habits of ordinary life rough and simple.\n",
      "The same principle of restriction, which was established in the\n",
      "commerce of the country, existed in the retail trade. The towns of\n",
      "England were of natural and accidental growth, accumulations of\n",
      "men who had gathered for purposes of self-defence or convenience,\n",
      "living in accordance with the ordinary habits of the country, in\n",
      "the same position, in fact, with regard to the king and their\n",
      "lords as any other society of men--citizens originally by right of\n",
      "the possession of land, and as the system of lordship established\n",
      "itself, bound to customary duties to their lord, just as the\n",
      "inhabitants of the country were. In the same way the citizens\n",
      "of the town, with the exception of these customary duties, were\n",
      "free and self-governing. They gradually, and chiefly by means of\n",
      "purchase, obtained freedom from the customary duties, and thus\n",
      "became independent, self-governing communities. Charters securing\n",
      "them freedom, in the case of the royal cities at all events, were\n",
      "many of them due to the necessities of the Angevin kings, and to\n",
      "their want of money for the payment of their mercenary troops. The\n",
      "close neighbourhood of the inhabitants of towns early introduced\n",
      "an artificial system of union, analogous to the frankpledge.\n",
      "Men formed themselves into what were known as frith-guilds,[74]\n",
      "the members of which were mutually responsible for one another,\n",
      "met at periodical feasts, supported one another’s poor, and in\n",
      "other respects performed the duties of members of an artificial\n",
      "family. As trade increased these guilds in the generality of cases\n",
      "coalesced into one, which took upon itself the direction of trade,\n",
      "and was known as the merchant guild. With the natural tendency\n",
      "of a governing body, this old merchant guild became exceedingly\n",
      "exclusive. New-comers to the town were not admitted to it, and\n",
      "craftsmen were generally excluded from its limits. In turn those\n",
      "craftsmen established guilds of their own, known as craft-guilds,\n",
      "by the warden and leaders of which the bye-laws of the particular\n",
      "craft were formed. Between these and their aristocratic neighbours,\n",
      "the merchant guild, quarrels arose, and in the thirteenth and\n",
      "fourteenth centuries the contest between the two was fought out,\n",
      "the craft-guilds eventually securing their acknowledgment and a\n",
      "share in the government of the town. Speaking generally, therefore,\n",
      "we may conceive of the towns of England as being divided into a\n",
      "series of guilds, the leaders of which usually formed a governing\n",
      "body, and which were capable of making bye-laws for their own\n",
      "special members. The commercial aim of these associations was,\n",
      "to insure good work, to insure work for all its members, and to\n",
      "resist that spirit of competition which was gradually rising, and\n",
      "which ended in the creation of two classes, the capitalist and\n",
      "the workman. To secure these objects, they limited the number of\n",
      "master workmen, admitted candidates to their association only after\n",
      "lengthened apprenticeships, limited the number of apprentices each\n",
      "master might employ, and kept a close supervision over the articles\n",
      "made, which were usually authenticated by the corporation mark.[75]\n",
      "\n",
      "These restrictions upon industry at the close of our period were\n",
      "beginning to break down; round the master workmen, there was\n",
      "arising a class of journeymen or day labourers, whose ranks were\n",
      "constantly swelled by fugitive serfs from the country; while, on\n",
      "the other side, individual enterprise was making itself felt, and\n",
      "capital was being collected, the owners of which refused to submit\n",
      "to the old corporation laws. The constant supervision both of trade\n",
      "and of the work of artisans supported the notion that governing\n",
      "bodies had the right to set prices on the articles under their\n",
      "control, a principle which was used not only by the guilds, but by\n",
      "the Government, as when, in the famine years of 1315 and 1316, it\n",
      "prescribed the exact price of all articles of food. As this had\n",
      "the natural effect of keeping things entirely out of the market,\n",
      "so that butcher’s meat disappeared altogether, it was shortly\n",
      "repealed; the prices to be demanded for victuals were constantly\n",
      "subject to the supervision of justices. The assize of bread, which\n",
      "is commonly assigned to the fifty-first year of Henry III., 1266,\n",
      "regulated the price in accordance with the market prices of corn,\n",
      "but the assizes of other matters, such as wine, wood, fish, fowls,\n",
      "etc., seem to have been perfectly arbitrary.\n",

      "merchants, in whose hands the whole trade of the East was, brought\n",
      "their goods largely to England; indeed, in 1379, a Genoese merchant\n",
      "is said to have suggested to Richard II. to make Southampton the\n",
      "emporium of all the oriental trade of the North. So great was the\n",
      "importance of the English shipping, that Edward III. distinctly\n",
      "claimed for himself and his predecessors the dominion of the\n",
      "sea.[77] The ships were, however, though numerous, of small burden;\n",
      "in the great fleet employed by Edward at Calais, there were 710\n",
      "vessels, with crews amounting to 14,151 persons, which would give\n",
      "an average crew of about twenty men; and as it is said that there\n",
      "were about sixty-five sailors to every hundred tons, it would make\n",
      "the average size of the vessels very small. Indeed, a ship manned\n",
      "by thirty seamen, employed to convey Edward I. to the Continent,\n",
      "was regarded as a wonder for its size. Of navy, properly speaking,\n",
      "there was little or none. There were only twenty-five royal ships\n",
      "at Calais, the rest were all merchantmen pressed for the service.\n",
      "About this time it became habitual to put cannon on board ships.\n",

      "English trade for the English, and moved perhaps by the wealth of\n",
      "his allies the Flemish, attempted to introduce the manufacture\n",
      "of finer cloths. In 1331, he invited weavers and fullers from\n",

      "The fact of so much trouble being taken to organize trade shows\n",

      "it was certain to produce wealth. The standard of comfort among\n",
      "all classes was improving, though there was nothing like what we\n",
      "should now speak of as luxury. The furniture used, even in the\n",
      "houses of the rich, was still rude. Things which are now found\n",
      "everywhere, and taken as matters of course, were then valuable\n",
      "rarities--beds, bedsteads, and rich clothing were frequently left\n",
      "by will. The lists of moveables, on which taxes were paid, are\n",
      "exceedingly meagre. A stool or two, a chest, and a few metal pots,\n",
      "constituted the ordinary supply of furniture. In the houses of\n",
      "the very rich, art had indeed begun to show itself. The payments\n",
      "of Henry III. to foreign artists for paintings in his house are\n",
      "mentioned. Intercourse with the French, and especially with\n",
      "the Spaniards, tended to increase these more luxurious habits.\n",
      "Carpets had always been used by Eastern people, and the Moors\n",
      "had introduced the custom in Spain. Thus, on the marriage of\n",
      "Edward I., before the arrival of Eleanor of Castile, her brother,\n",
      "the Archbishop of Toledo, made his appearance. The hangings\n",
      "of his chamber excited the wonder of the people, and Edward,\n",
      "always inclined to ostentation, had the rooms of the bride elect\n",
      "similarly decorated. This is said to have been the introduction\n",
      "of carpets to England; but still the usual covering of the floor\n",
      "was rushes. There is frequent mention of payments for rushes for\n",
      "the King’s chambers. In the matter of clothes the same change is\n",
      "observable. The extravagant court of Edward II. is said to have\n",
      "introduced parti-coloured garments. In Edward III’s reign, wealth\n",
      "had so increased in all ranks that it was found necessary to pass\n",
      "sumptuary laws, sharply dividing classes by the dress they were\n",
      "allowed to wear, and to confine silk and the finer woollen cloths\n",
      "to the higher ranks, for the sake perhaps of the English wool\n",
      "manufactures. In Richard II.’s reign, extravagance went still\n",
      "further. With his Queen, Anne of Bohemia, came in the awkward\n",
      "habit, soon adopted by all classes, of wearing long shoes, called\n",
      "cracowys or pykys, which required to be tied with silver chains\n",
      "to the knee before the wearer could move.[79] And Stowe says that\n",
      "Richard himself wore a garment made of gold, silver, and precious\n",
      "stones, worth 3000 marks. At the same time the rich built more\n",
      "comfortable houses. Castles ceased to be mere places of defence.\n",
      "They were at once strongholds and handsome dwelling-places. Warwick\n",
      "and Windsor castles may be looked on as fair specimens of the more\n",
      "magnificent buildings of the time. Meanwhile, though among the few,\n",

      "Parliament. Thither they came with all the exclusive notions\n",
      "which their trade traditions had fostered. They were as careless\n",
      "of the class below them as the Barons. Indeed, it would be true\n",
      "to say that the feeling of the House of Commons was completely\n",
      "aristocratic. One part of it was of necessity entirely so: the\n",
      "knights of the shire, originally the representatives of the lower\n",
      "baronage, were elected in the county court, which was the general\n",
      "meeting-place of all freeholders, whether they held immediately\n",
      "from the crown or not. Consequently, the baronial freeholders\n",
      "became merged in the lesser freeholders, and the class of gentry\n",
      "was created. Many things had tended to the increase of that class.\n",
      "The breaking up of great properties, the division of property\n",
      "among younger children, and alienation, had increased the number\n",
      "of freeholders. The statute “Quia Emptores,” intended as a check\n",
      "upon subinfeudation, had really increased alienation by authorizing\n",
      "it. The smaller estates, thus separated from the large baronies,\n",
      "had to be worked to profit, and could not be regarded merely as\n",
      "means of military or political influence. There thus had arisen\n",
      "an industrial as well as a military class of landholders. The\n",
      "representatives of towns, also elected upon a writ directed to\n",
      "the Sheriff, were, if not at first, certainly soon after elected\n",
      "in the county courts. This similarity of election united the two\n",
      "classes in feeling; and the smaller baronies, small landowners, and\n",
      "burghers, formed the body of representative Commons, aristocratic\n",
      "in feeling in accordance with the origin of the more aristocratic\n",
      "part of the class. It is thus that we find the Commons regarding\n",
      "the Barons as their natural leaders, not joining the crown against\n",
      "them as in France. Edward III., in his difficulties with Stratford,\n",
      "had tried to produce this combination, but had failed; and the\n",
      "Commons joining with the Barons, had insisted on the restoration\n",
      "to favour of that prelate. And thus, too, we find the Commons\n",
      "without sympathy with the demands of the rebels in Wat Tyler’s\n",

      "In their hatred to the Church they made common cause with all\n",

      "given the Popes in England was the primary cause of this dislike.\n",
      "Annates, or first-fruits, had been early demanded, but the great\n",
      "grievance, as we have seen, was Provisors. Against this assumption\n",
      "of authority, which forestalled the rights of the patrons, there\n",
      "was the strongest feeling. The exactions of the Pope had been\n",
      "strongly spoken of in the Statute of Carlisle in the end of\n",
      "Edward’s I.’s reign. Edward II., like other weak princes, had\n",
      "yielded to this assumption. But in Edward III.’s reign, a series of\n",
      "enactments were passed, each one stronger than the last, against\n",
      "the interference of the Papacy. In 1343 the Statute of Carlisle had\n",
      "been read, and it was enacted that no more Papal instruments should\n",
      "be allowed in England. In 1344, the penalty of exile was pronounced\n",
      "against all provisors. By a Statute of the 25th year of Edward\n",

      "the matter was to come into the King’s hands, and penalties were\n",
      "enacted. In the 38th year of his reign these enactments were all\n",
      "confirmed and strengthened by the Statute of Provisors, by which\n",
      "the introduction of Papal Bulls and Briefs was forbidden. The\n",
      "strife, as we have seen, was continued in Richard II.’s reign,\n",
      "and finally completed in the 16th year of that King, by a statute\n",
      "declaring the freedom of the crown of England, which was in earthly\n",
      "subjection to no realm, and pronouncing the penalties of the\n",
      "Præmunire against all who should purchase or procure any Bulls from\n",
      "the Court of Rome; any who were guilty of this should be put out of\n",
      "the King’s peace, and forfeit all their property. In Edward III.’s\n",
      "reign, also, the annual tribute, or census, as it was called, of\n",
      "a thousand marks was left unpaid. At the end of Edward I.’s reign\n",
      "17,000 marks had become due. Edward II. paid this, and continued\n",
      "throughout his reign to discharge the debt. Edward III. was again\n",
      "strong enough to refuse the payment, and in 1366, Urban V. demanded\n",
      "the arrears of thirty-three years. The King laid the matter before\n",
      "his Parliament, and an instrument was drawn up in the name of the\n",

      "idleness of the older monastic orders, the spiritual encroachments\n",
      "and licentious lives of the new mendicant orders, had excited\n",
      "popular anger. The charges against them are humorously summed\n",
      "up in the Song of the Order of Fair-ease, a description of an\n",
      "imaginary order, to which each existing class of monks subscribes\n",

      "whose order is founded on poverty, will never lodge with a poor\n",
      "man so long as there are richer men to be found. In the same way\n",
      "the constant interference of the consistory courts was the cause\n",
      "of popular complaint. “Yet there sit somnours, six or seven,\n",

      "To crown all, the doctrine itself of the Church had begun to be\n",
      "questioned. In 1360, the name of Wicliffe first becomes prominent.\n",
      "His first attack was upon the mendicant orders, who had contrived\n",
      "to get into their hands much of the education of the country. From\n",
      "this time onwards he continually waged war against the abuses of\n",
      "the Church. The clergy, he urged, should be poor, in imitation\n",
      "of Christ. This doctrine he carried out by the establishment\n",
      "of an order of poor priests. With regard to the Sacrament, he\n",
      "appealed to common sense; and while not yet ready to attack the\n",
      "doctrine of Transubstantiation, upheld that the elements taken\n",
      "were really bread and wine. But his great work was neither his\n",
      "assault on the wealth of the clergy, nor his attack on their\n",
      "doctrine, but the translation of the Bible into English, which\n",
      "was, in fact, an appeal to private judgment in opposition to\n",
      "ecclesiastical authority. His influence was very widespread. His\n",
      "poor priests worked largely among the lower orders, and his view\n",
      "of the necessity of poverty for the clergy was so in harmony with\n",
      "the feelings of the day, that it met with ready acceptance. As has\n",
      "been mentioned, the Church was too strong for him. He was obliged,\n",
      "when the support of John of Gaunt failed him, to make some sort\n",
      "of recantation, and retire to his living of Lutterworth. But his\n",
      "disciples are said to have numbered a third of the population of\n",
      "England, and when, as was inevitable, social and political views\n",

      "dread, not only to the Church, but also to the Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Sidenote: The lower classes.]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is perhaps in the lower commons that social change is most\n",
      "obvious. The great insurrection of Wat Tyler is a sign of something\n",
      "more than mere temporary discontent. Agricultural villeinage was\n",
      "disappearing, and giving birth to a new class almost peculiar\n",
      "to England, the free but landless labourer. The existence of\n",
      "this class first comes prominently into notice in the Statute of\n",
      "Labourers. In the terrible pestilence of the Black Death which\n",
      "had ravaged England, a third, perhaps a half, of the population\n",
      "had been carried off. Labour became scarce. The labourers took\n",
      "the opportunity of making what we should now call a strike for\n",
      "higher wages. Such a demand, however consonant with economical\n",
      "principles, was quite repugnant to the feelings of that age, when\n",
      "prices were a constant matter of legal enactment. The Statute of\n",
      "Labourers, stating in its preamble that servants, taking advantage\n",
      "of the necessities of their masters, would not serve except for\n",
      "excessive wages, enacted that every able-bodied man should be\n",
      "bound to serve any one who required him at the old wages under\n",
      "pain of imprisonment; and that every master giving more than the\n",
      "old wages should forfeit thrice the sum he had offered. Such an\n",
      "ordinance could not be kept; but strenuous efforts were made to\n",
      "insist upon it, and again and again in some form or other it was\n",
      "re-enacted. But whether successful or not, it shows the existence\n",
      "of labour for wages, and of a rising knowledge on the part of the\n",
      "labourers of the value of their work. Several causes combined to\n",
      "create this labouring class. The early form of agricultural society\n",
      "may be roughly described as a village of serfs lying round the\n",
      "manor-house of their lord. Each serf had his share in the common\n",
      "fields of the village, and was bound to join in the cultivation of\n",
      "his lord’s domain or manor farm. For the simple farming at that\n",
      "time prevalent this forced labour was sufficient; and the lord\n",
      "valued his serfs more for military purposes than as agricultural\n",
      "labourers. As subinfeudation and alienation went on, the holders of\n",
      "small properties were obliged to work their land to better profit.\n",
      "The alienations also were chiefly made from the lord’s domain, but\n",
      "it was not usual to part with serfs. Consequently, their number\n",
      "increased, while the domain land diminished; there were more hands\n",
      "than the lord could employ, and the tenant working for profit could\n",
      "therefore find labour among the surplus serfs who would work for\n",
      "wages. A change in the character of war took place at the same\n",
      "time. The insular condition of England made the feudal arrangement\n",
      "with its limited term of service inconvenient; in the highest\n",
      "ranks, therefore, military service was changed to scutage or money\n",
      "payment, and a large number of dependants became less desirable\n",
      "than money; proprietors were willing to work their farms with fewer\n",
      "servants and to receive money rent instead of service. There were\n",
      "thus at work the two principles which broke down villein labour;\n",
      "labour paid by wages, and land held for money rent. The change in\n",
      "war had another effect. Armies were raised by contract with some\n",
      "great lord. The payment was beyond the ordinary agricultural wages.\n",
      "The earl himself received a mark a day, the common foot-soldier,\n",
      "3d. or 4d., and the archer, 6d.[80] Anxious to fulfil his contract,\n",
      "the leader would not be careful to inquire whether he was enlisting\n",
      "serfs or not. On his return from a war, the well-paid soldier would\n",
      "be unwilling to fall back into a state of serfdom. He swelled the\n",
      "ranks of wage-paid labour. Again, the residence of a year and a day\n",
      "uninterrupted within the limits of a borough gave freedom. Serfs,\n",
      "seeing the advantage of money payments, fled thither and became\n",
      "free. Again, the Church, in whose eyes all men were equal, would\n",
      "not refuse to admit them within its ranks; a serf could thus become\n",
      "a priest or monk, and withdraw himself from his lord’s power. On\n",
      "the same principle, the Church constantly urged the manumission\n",
      "of serfs. To all these causes was now added the disarrangement of\n",
      "labour consequent on the Black Death. With a general demand for\n",
      "labour all superfluous hands would find easy employment, perhaps\n",
      "at a considerable distance from their old homes. With a sufficient\n",
      "supply himself, the lord would not waste time or money to redeem\n",
      "them. We thus see how there may have been a vast number of free\n",
      "labourers in England. The Statute of Labourers, destroying their\n",
      "freedom of bargain, attempted, though with but partial success, to\n",
      "force these free labourers back into a semi-servile condition. But\n",
      "they had now joined the ranks of freemen, such as the small farmers\n",
      "of Kent, and the unincorporated artisans of towns. The spirit of\n",
      "equality fostered by the teaching of the mendicant friars, who had\n",
      "reached England in Henry III.’s reign, and who took up their abode\n",
      "among the poor city populations, was still further increased by the\n",

      "While the two sections of the commons were thus rising in social\n",
      "position, a change had also taken place in the character of the\n",
      "nobility. It may be roughly characterized as the change from\n",
      "feudalism to chivalry.[82] Many of the same causes which had\n",
      "conduced to the freedom of the labourer had tended to loosen the\n",
      "territorial system on which the ancient strength of the nobility\n",
      "rested. Especially had the voluntary character of military service\n",
      "dealt heavy blows at the practical side of feudalism. Soldiering\n",
      "was no longer the necessary duty of every man; but the military\n",
      "spirit remained, and to the bulk of the aristocracy fighting became\n",
      "a pastime. The subordination of proprietors gave place to a sort\n",
      "of system of freemasonry, to which all knights were admitted.\n",
      "Knighthood made its holder any man’s equal for actual military\n",
      "purposes. It was no longer the great noble, but the good soldier,\n",
      "who was the commander. Manny, Chandos, Knowles, all of them simple\n",
      "knights, were the generals to whom Edward III. trusted. As an\n",
      "amusement war was decked with ostentatious ornament. This is the\n",
      "period of showy tournaments, of armorial bearings, and of grotesque\n",
      "vows, like that of the young knights who attended Edward with black\n",
      "patches over their eyes. It is this chivalrous aspect of war which\n",
      "explains the short-lived character of Edward’s expeditions. But it\n",
      "had a more important effect. Importance in the country became a\n",
      "more personal matter; partly from love of show, partly to produce\n",
      "respect, great men began to surround themselves, not with feudal\n",
      "followers, but with paid retainers. To these they granted liveries.\n",
      "It was a point of honour among these retainers to stand by each\n",
      "other and by their chief. Quite in the beginning of Richard II.’s\n",
      "reign, the Commons petitioned against these liveries and the bands\n",
      "of maintainers,[83] who upheld each other in illegal actions. Thus\n",
      "great households, and by degrees factions, were formed, and things\n",

      "of a somewhat degraded type. We have here a perfect division of\n",

      "of heresy. In 1430, a man calling himself Jack Sharpe had been\n",
      "put to death at Oxford, and a clergyman of Essex had also been\n",

      "execution, and made offerings as though the victim of persecution\n",
      "had been a saint. But even worse for Bedford than these troubles\n",
      "at home was the loss of his wife, who died in November 1432,\n",
      "childless, thus breaking the strongest link which had hitherto\n",
      "bound England and Burgundy together. This misfortune was made\n",
      "worse by one of the few acts of indiscretion which can be alleged\n",
      "against Bedford. He married Jacquetta, daughter of the Count of\n",
      "Saint-Pol, of the House of Luxembourg, a marriage in itself politic\n",
      "enough, but which, contracted as it was without the permission of\n",
      "Burgundy, the lady’s feudal superior, caused a quarrel between\n",
      "the two Dukes. This was the second heavy blow which the alliance\n",
      "between England and Burgundy had received. Yet this alliance was\n",
      "absolutely necessary for the successful carrying on of the war. It\n",
      "began to be a question whether peace of some sort was not becoming\n",
      "necessary. Bedford even in the year 1431 received leave from the\n",
      "English Parliament to treat. Abroad the feeling in favour of peace\n",
      "was still stronger. Pope Eugenius IV. had set seriously to work to\n",
      "put an end to the warfare. The Emperor Sigismund, with Frederick\n",
      "of Austria and Louis of Orange, alarmed at the rising power of\n",
      "the Burgundian House, had made offers of assistance to the French\n",

      "to renew their natural alliance with France. Burgundy himself, in\n",
      "1432, had gone so far as to make an armistice with the French; the\n",
      "presence at the French Court of La Tremouille, one of the murderers\n",
      "of the Duke’s father and the constant supporter of the war, seemed\n",
      "the only obstacle to reconciliation: if that reconciliation were\n",
      "made Bedford must of necessity make peace. Other difficulties\n",
      "were leading him in the same direction. The finances were in\n",
      "the greatest disorder; the garrison of Calais mutinied for pay.\n",
      "Bedford therefore, in 1433, returned to England to see what could\n",
      "be done. He made Lord Ralph Cromwell his treasurer, and intrusted\n",
      "him with the duty of examining and making a statement as to the\n",
      "condition of the finances. It became apparent that the yearly\n",
      "outgoing exceeded the income by £25,000. Bedford at once insisted\n",
      "on economy, and patriotically gave up a considerable portion of\n",
      "his own salaries. But the discovery of his failing resources, the\n",
      "necessity for his presence in England, where Lords and Commons\n",
      "united in intreating him to remain, the increase of the power of\n",
      "France, and the constant danger of reconciliation between Charles\n",
      "and Burgundy, induced him to be quite ready to make arrangements\n",
      "for a peace on honourable terms which should include the possession\n",

      "prominently forward as the head of the war party, producing a great\n",

      "regard to family, it would seem that the quarrel was one of very\n",
      "long standing, dating back as far as the reign of Richard II. It\n",
      "has been already pointed out that there was constantly some branch\n",
      "or other of the Plantagenet party in opposition to the reigning\n",
      "branch, which took for its cry reform of government and the good\n",
      "cause of England. In Richard II.’s reign Gloucester had represented\n",
      "this party. If we take the names of the Lords Appellant in the\n",
      "year 1387, we find them to be Gloucester and Derby, Plantagenets;\n",
      "Warwick, a Beauchamp; Nottingham, a Mowbray; and Arundel. Now, of\n",
      "these, the second, Derby, became afterwards King as Henry IV.,\n",
      "and the opposition which he had at one time helped to direct was\n",
      "turned against himself and his family. The families of Mowbray\n",
      "and of Arundel had coalesced in the Duke of Norfolk. The heiress\n",
      "of the Beauchamps had married the Earl of Salisbury’s son Richard\n",
      "Neville, who with his wife had inherited the title of Warwick. The\n",
      "addition therefore to the party was that of the important family\n",
      "of the Nevilles, which had been consistently faithful to Henry IV.\n",
      "But this family had now become allied by marriage with the Duke\n",
      "of York himself (who had married Cecily Neville), with the Duke\n",
      "of Norfolk, and as we have seen with the family of Beauchamp. In\n",
      "addition to this, the fact that the rival house of the Percies had\n",
      "since the restoration of the son of Hotspur been firm supporters of\n",
      "the Lancastrian dynasty, would have been enough to put the Nevilles\n",
      "on the opposite side. The two families had ever been rivals for\n",
      "the chief influence in the North of England; and even now Lord\n",
      "Egremont, a Percy, was at open war with the Earl of Salisbury in\n",
      "the neighbourhood of York. Of the leaders appearing on the side\n",
      "of Henry, Northumberland was a Percy, and therefore enemy of the\n",
      "Nevilles; Somerset was a Beaufort, and of the Lancastrian house;\n",
      "Pembroke and Richmond were the King’s half-brothers; Clifford\n",
      "was one of the great lords of the North, and an opponent of the\n",
      "Nevilles; Wiltshire was James Butler of Ormond, of that family\n",
      "whose misgovernment York had been sent to cure. Of Buckingham and\n",

      "resting upon merely personal grounds. But beyond these there were\n",
      "geographical and political reasons which had their influence on\n",

      "support given to the national prejudice in favour of continued war,\n",

      "lay. To this of course must be added the very large estates held\n",
      "by York himself, as the heir of the Mortimers in the West; and\n",
      "the vast property of the various branches of the Nevilles. On the\n",

      "proceeded to expatiate upon the lax life of the late King; and\n",

      "that King was himself illegitimate. As for the present Princes,\n",
      "he asserted that they too were bastards. According to him, before\n",
      "Edward’s marriage with Elizabeth Woodville, he had been engaged\n",
      "to Lady Eleanor Talbot; by the laws of the Church, therefore,\n",
      "his subsequent marriage was void, and the King and his brothers\n",
      "illegitimate. He drew attention to the want of resemblance between\n",
      "Richard of York and Edward IV., and the close likeness which\n",
      "existed, on the other hand, between Richard and the Protector. At\n",
      "this moment the Protector made his appearance, expecting that the\n",
      "crowd would cry, “Long live, King Richard!” But the charges were\n",
      "too new and surprising; he was received in perfect silence. The\n",

      "of the height to which such families might rise. From the decay of\n",
      "noble families, and other more permanent causes, land had been\n",
      "necessarily brought into the market. Wealthy traders had purchased\n",

      "At the same time, the secondary gentry of the country, taking\n",
      "advantage of the decline of the nobility, found means in the midst\n",

      "there was improvement. But the change from slavery to personal\n",

      "price is the existence of poverty; it is no longer incumbent\n",

      "the towns, or join the ranks of the rapidly increasing class of\n",
      "beggars. He there found himself in company of numbers of idle\n",
      "and needy men who took advantage of the disturbed state of the\n",
      "country. Discharged soldiers and sailors, and vagabonds who called\n",
      "themselves travelling scholars, were so plentiful, that as there\n",
      "was as yet no poor law in existence, stringent enactments were\n",
      "made against them. The number of those punished for crimes of\n",
      "lawlessness and violence was enormous. Fortescue describes with\n",
      "pride how the poor Englishman, seeing others possess what he\n",
      "wanted, would never scruple to take it by violence rather than be\n",
      "without it. Those of the unemployed labourers who preferred to\n",
      "seek the towns went to increase the crowd of journeymen, whose\n",
      "position could not have been very enviable. For the guild system\n",
      "was breaking down and giving place to the more modern arrangements\n",
      "of unlimited competition. The craft guilds, which in the thirteenth\n",
      "and fourteenth centuries had triumphed over the merchant guilds\n",
      "and aristocratic citizens of the towns, had speedily begun to\n",
      "deteriorate. The object for which they were founded was to secure\n",
      "for all members of the craft a fair chance of livelihood, without\n",
      "the danger of destructive competition. This object implied that the\n",
      "guild was co-extensive with the trade, and that its members were\n",
      "themselves craftsmen, carrying on their work with their own hands,\n",
      "with the assistance of apprentices. But a crowd of enfranchised\n",
      "villeins and unemployed labourers had gathered in the towns, and\n",
      "formed a class of journeymen or day-labourers, and the guild,\n",
      "originally a corporation of working men, changed gradually into\n",
      "an exclusive body of capitalists. Moreover, even within their own\n",
      "limits, their principles had failed as early as the reign of Edward\n",
      "III. We hear, for instance, of certain pepperers, who, separating\n",
      "themselves from their guild, became grocers [grossers] or general\n",
      "dealers. In other words, as individuals accumulated capital, they\n",
      "refused to have their enterprise limited by the guild laws; and\n",
      "thus setting up as independent capitalists, began to introduce\n",
      "the same relations between employer and employed which exist at\n",
      "present. Under these circumstances the unincorporated journeymen\n",

      "spread, and that the laity were gradually becoming sufficiently\n",
      "cultivated to rival the Churchmen, and to take their proper part in\n",

      "PREFACE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Until within the past few years, Mexico was a country not easily reached\n",
      "from the principal cities of the United States, and our relations with\n",
      "it were by no means intimate. Since the completion of the railway from\n",
      "the frontier of Texas to the heart of the most northerly of the\n",
      "Spanish-American republics, there has been a rapid development of\n",
      "commercial and social relations between Mexico and the United States,\n",
      "and the tide of travel from one country to the other is steadily\n",
      "increasing year by year. These circumstances have led the author of \"The\n",
      "Boy Travellers\" to believe that his young friends everywhere would\n",
      "welcome a book describing the land of the Aztecs, its history and\n",
      "resources, the manners and customs of its people, and the many curious\n",
      "things to be seen, and adventures passed through, in a journey from one\n",
      "end of that country to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this belief he sought the aid of his and their friends, Frank and\n",
      "Fred, immediately after their return from Australasia. Ever ready to be\n",
      "of service, the youths assented to his request to make a tour of the\n",
      "Mexican republic, in company with their guide and mentor, Doctor\n",
      "Bronson, and the result of their journey is set forth in the following\n",
      "pages. It is confidently hoped that the narrative will be found in every\n",
      "particular fully equal to any of its predecessors in the series to which\n",
      "it belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methods on which the Boy Travellers have hitherto performed their\n",
      "work have been adhered to in the present volume. In addition to his\n",
      "personal acquaintance with Mexico and travels in that country, the\n",
      "author has drawn upon the observations of those who have preceded and\n",
      "followed him there. He has consulted books of history, travel, and\n",
      "statistics in great number, has sought the best and most accurate maps,\n",
      "and while his work was in progress he consulted many persons familiar\n",
      "with Mexico, and was in frequent correspondence with gentlemen now\n",
      "residing there. He has sought to bring the social, political, and\n",
      "commercial history of the country down to the latest date, and to\n",
      "present a truthful picture of the present status of our sister\n",
      "republic. The result of his efforts he submits herewith to the judgment\n",
      "of his readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the works that have been consulted are named in the text, but it\n",
      "has not been convenient to refer to all. Among those to which the author\n",
      "is indebted may be mentioned the following: Bishop's \"Old Mexico and her\n",
      "Lost Provinces,\" Griffin's \"Mexico of To-day,\" Haven's \"Our Next-door\n",
      "Neighbor,\" Charnay's \"Ancient Cities of the New World,\" Squier's\n",
      "\"Nicaragua\" and \"Central America,\" Wells's \"Honduras,\" Stephens's\n",

      "America,\" Wilson's \"Mexico and its Religions,\" Abbott's \"Hernando\n",
      "Cortez,\" Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico,\" Ober's \"Travels in Mexico,\"\n",
      "Geiger's \"Peep at Mexico,\" Gooch's \"Face to Face with the Mexicans,\"\n",
      "Chevalier's \"Mexique Ancien et Moderne,\" and the hand-books of Janvier,\n",
      "Conkling, and Hamilton.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the other \"Boy Traveller\" volumes, the author is indebted to the\n",
      "liberality of his publishers, Messrs. Harper & Brothers, for the use of\n",
      "engravings that have appeared in previous publications relative to\n",
      "Mexico and Central America, in addition to those specially prepared for\n",
      "this book. As a result of their generosity, he has been enabled to add\n",
      "greatly to the interest of the work, particularly to the younger portion\n",
      "of his readers, for whom illustrations always have an especial charm.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're going to Mexico next week,\" answered Fred; \"at any rate, that is\n",
      "uncle's plan, and he will tell us all about it this evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The news is good news,\" was the reply; \"for Mexico is one of the\n",
      "countries that just now I want very much to see. We have heard a great\n",
      "deal about it since the railway was completed to the capital; and then,\n",
      "you know, the Mexicans are our neighbors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" said Fred; \"here we've been going all over the rest of\n",
      "the world, and haven't yet called on our neighbors, and next-door\n",
      "neighbors too. But we're not alone in this, as it is probable that for\n",
      "every inhabitant of the Northern States who has visited Mexico, a\n",
      "hundred have been across the Atlantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation occurred between Frank Bassett and Fred Bronson\n",
      "shortly after returning from their tour among the islands of the Pacific\n",
      "Ocean and through New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia. The accounts of\n",
      "their journeys have appeared in several volumes, with which our readers\n",
      "are or should be familiar.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "[1] \"The Boy Travellers in the Far East\" (five volumes), and \"The Boy\n",
      "Travellers in South America,\" \"The Boy Travellers in the Russian\n",
      "Empire,\" \"The Boy Travellers on the Congo,\" and \"The Boy Travellers in\n",
      "Australasia\" (four volumes). See complete list at the end of this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths waited with some impatience until evening, when they were to\n",
      "hear from Doctor Bronson the details of the proposed trip. In the mean\n",
      "time they devoted themselves to their Spanish grammars and dictionaries,\n",
      "which they had not seen for months, owing to their occupation with other\n",
      "matters. And we may here add that until their departure and while they\n",
      "were on the road, every moment that could be applied to the study of the\n",
      "language of the country whither they were bound was industriously\n",
      "employed. By the time they crossed the border they were able to speak\n",
      "Spanish very well, and had very little need of interpreters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall go to Mexico by rail,\" said the Doctor, \"and return by sea; at\n",
      "any rate, that is my plan at present, but circumstances may change it.\n",
      "It is my intention to visit the principal cities and other places of\n",
      "interest, and also to give some attention to the antiquities of the\n",
      "country and of Central America; exactly what places we shall see I\n",
      "cannot say at this moment, nor how long we shall be absent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we need in the way of baggage?\" one of the youths asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About what you need for a long journey north and south in the United\n",
      "States,\" was the reply. \"You will need clothing for hot weather as well\n",
      "as for cold. We shall find it quite chilly in certain parts of the\n",
      "_tierra fria_, or highlands, and warm enough in the _tierra caliente_,\n",
      "or lowlands along the coast. You must have outer and under clothing\n",
      "adapted to warm and cool climates, and your ulsters may be placed for\n",
      "convenience in the same bundle with your linen dusters. Have a good\n",
      "supply of under-clothing, as the facilities for laundry-work are not the\n",
      "best, even in the large cities; but do not load yourselves with anything\n",
      "not absolutely necessary, as the Mexican railways allow only\n",
      "thirty-three pounds of baggage to a local passenger, and the charges for\n",
      "extra weight are high. Passengers with through tickets from the United\n",
      "States are entitled to one hundred and fifty pounds of baggage free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" continued the Doctor, \"you will want some books on Mexico,\n",
      "partly for historical research and partly for description. There is an\n",
      "excellent guide-book which was written by Mr. Janvier, and there is\n",
      "another by Mr. Conkling; get them both, and also 'Old Mexico and her\n",
      "Lost Provinces,' by Mr. Bishop, 'Mexico of To-day,' by Mr. Griffin, and\n",
      "'Our Next-door Neighbor,' by Bishop Haven. Don't forget Charnay's\n",
      "'Ancient Cities of the New World,' and Prescott's 'Conquest of Mexico.'\n",
      "You can read the latter book before we go; it is inconveniently large\n",
      "for travelling purposes, and so we will leave it behind us, as we can\n",
      "easily find it in the City of Mexico, in case we wish to refer to it\n",
      "again. Abbott's 'Life of Hernando Cortez' is a more portable work, and\n",
      "will serve to refresh your memory concerning what you read in Prescott's\n",
      "volumes.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The conversation lasted an hour or more, and by the time it ended the\n",
      "boys almost felt that they were already in the land of the Aztecs. Their\n",
      "dreams through the night were of ancient temples and modern palaces,\n",
      "Aztec and Spanish warriors, snowy mountains and palm-covered plains,\n",
      "mines of silver and other metals, fortresses, cathedrals, haciendas and\n",
      "hovels, and of many races and tribes of men that dwell in the land they\n",
      "were about to see. Fred declared in the morning that he had dreamed of\n",
      "Montezuma and Maximilian walking arm in arm, and Frank professed to have\n",
      "had a similar vision concerning Cortez and General Scott.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next few days the youths had no spare time on their hands, and\n",
      "when the start was made for the proposed journey they were well prepared\n",
      "for it both mentally and materially. They had followed Doctor Bronson's\n",
      "directions as to their outfit of clothing and other things, had procured\n",
      "the books which he named, and, as we have already seen, had made a\n",
      "vigorous overhauling of their Spanish grammars and phrase-books.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE ON THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD.]\n",
      "\n",
      "From New York there are several routes westward, as our readers are\n",
      "pretty well aware, and the youths were a little puzzled to know which\n",
      "one would be chosen. The mystery was solved by the Doctor on the day\n",
      "before their departure. He announced that they would go to St. Louis by\n",
      "the Pennsylvania Railroad, and from there to the frontier of Mexico by\n",
      "the Missouri Pacific and Southern Pacific lines. \"And now,\" said he, \"I\n",
      "will leave you to choose the route to the capital city, and you need not\n",
      "decide until we reach St. Louis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor's suggestion compelled a study of the maps and a careful\n",
      "reading of the guide-books and other literature pertaining to the\n",
      "journey. The result of their study may be summed up as follows from an\n",
      "entry which Frank made in his note-book:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: STREET IN EL PASO.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first railway which was opened from the United States to the City\n",
      "of Mexico was the Mexican Central, which runs from El Paso, Texas, or\n",
      "rather from Paso del Norte, Mexico, which is opposite to El Paso, on the\n",
      "other side of the Rio Grande. Its length is 1224 miles, and it was\n",
      "completed March 8, 1884, at the station of Fresnillo, 750 miles from\n",
      "Paso del Norte, the line having been built from both ends at the same\n",
      "time. Three years and six months were required for its construction, and\n",
      "the line is said to have cost more than thirty-two millions of dollars;\n",
      "eight miles of track were laid during the last day of the work before\n",
      "the two ends of the line were brought together; and considering all the\n",
      "disadvantages of the enterprise, it reflects great credit upon those who\n",
      "managed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For more than four years the Mexican Central was the only all-rail\n",
      "route for travellers from the United States to the City of Mexico, and\n",
      "it had a practical monopoly of business. In 1888 two other lines were\n",
      "opened; or perhaps we might say, another line and half of a third. These\n",
      "are the Mexican National Railway, from Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City, a\n",
      "distance of 825 miles, and the International Railway, from Piedras\n",
      "Negras, Mexico, opposite Eagle Pass, Texas, to a point on the Mexican\n",
      "Central, about half-way between El Paso and Mexico. The International is\n",
      "the one which we call half a line, as it makes a new route into Mexico,\n",
      "and from all we can learn a very good one too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Central is a standard-gauge road, four feet eight and one-half\n",
      "inches wide, while the National is a narrow-gauge line, three feet\n",
      "between the rails; the advantage of the National line is that it is much\n",
      "shorter than the Central, as I will proceed to show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From St. Louis to Mexico City, by way of Laredo, the distance is 1823\n",
      "miles, while by the Central line it is 2584 miles; there is thus a\n",
      "saving of 761 miles, or about thirty hours in time. But the Central will\n",
      "take us through five or six interesting cities, while the National only\n",
      "goes near Monterey, San Luis Potosi, and Toluca.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred and I have decided to ask uncle to go by neither one route nor the\n",
      "other, but to travel by both of them, and the International line in\n",
      "addition; and this is the way we propose to do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll go from St. Louis to Laredo because of the saving of time and\n",
      "distance, and then we'll go to Monterey, which is an interesting city,\n",
      "by the National Railway. After we've done Monterey we'll go farther on,\n",
      "to Saltillo, and there we can cross over to Jaral, about forty miles,\n",
      "and find ourselves on the main line of the International Railway. There\n",
      "the train will pick us up and carry us to Torreon, on the Mexican\n",
      "Central Railway, and from there we can continue to the capital, seeing\n",
      "the best part of the Central line, or rather of the country through\n",
      "which it runs. The northern part of the route of the Central is said to\n",
      "be dreary and uninteresting, and so we shall be able to avoid it by the\n",
      "plan we have made.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme was duly unfolded to the Doctor, who promptly gave his\n",
      "approval and commended the youths for the careful study they had made\n",
      "of the railway system of northern Mexico. \"Later on,\" said he, \"we will\n",
      "consider the subject of railways in other parts of Mexico, and I'm sure\n",
      "you will be able to make some interesting notes about it for your\n",
      "friends at home. Mexico was for a long time very backward in railway\n",
      "enterprises, but in the past few years she has gone ahead very rapidly.\n",
      "Ten years ago there were not five hundred miles of railway in the\n",
      "country; now there are nearly, if not quite, five thousand miles, and in\n",
      "ten years from this time there will be double that number. The Mexico of\n",
      "to-day is very different from the Mexico of a quarter of a century ago.\"\n",

      "admiration of the youths, who heard with much interest the story of its\n",

      "which, in 1836, the Texans, who were fighting for independence, so\n",
      "heroically but unsuccessfully defended. They were disappointed to find\n",
      "that there is not much remaining of the fort, which originally consisted\n",
      "of an oblong enclosure, about an acre in extent, with walls three feet\n",

      "was injured by them, while the Texan sharp-shooters picked off a great\n",
      "number of the Mexicans. Santa Anna made several assaults, but was driven\n",
      "back each time, and it is believed that he lost fully 1500 men in the\n",

      "Crockett fell with a dozen sword-wounds after his own weapons had been\n",
      "given up. Colonel Travis, who commanded the fort, was also killed, and\n",
      "so was Colonel Bowie, who was ill in bed at the time, and was shot where\n",
      "he lay. He was the inventor of the bowie-knife, which has been famous\n",

      "military posts in Louisiana. The territorial boundaries between France\n",
      "and Spain were never very clearly defined; the two countries were in a\n",

      "territory from France we inherited the dispute about the boundaries.\n",

      "the Texans set up a claim for independence, and the war which was ended\n",
      "by the battle of San Jacinto was like our Revolutionary War a hundred\n",
      "and more years ago. After Texas had secured her independence, she set up\n",
      "a government of her own; she had a president and all the other officials\n",
      "pertaining to a republic, and was recognized by England, France, and\n",
      "other European countries. This did not last long, as her finances fell\n",
      "into a deplorable condition, and the preponderance of Americans among\n",
      "the population naturally led to a movement for annexation to the United\n",
      "States. Annexation was followed by war with Mexico, and it grew out of\n",
      "the old dispute about the boundaries. Mexico claimed all land west of\n",
      "the Nueces River, while Texas claimed to own as far west as the Rio\n",
      "Grande. Each country believed it was right, and our war with Mexico\n",
      "resulted in the defeat of the Mexican armies, the occupation of their\n",

      "freely with the Americans who had lived long enough in Texas to feel at\n",
      "home. The Texas towns along the border contain a goodly number of\n",
      "residents who are engaged in defrauding the revenue of Mexico by\n",
      "engaging in the business of smuggling goods into that country; there is\n",
      "also a fair amount of smuggling from Mexico into the United States, and\n",
      "the customs officials on both sides are kept reasonably busy in seeing\n",

      "there is reason to suspect that the owner has an intention to sell; two\n",
      "or three suits of clothing will pass without question, but ten or twelve\n",
      "would be liable to detention and duty. The laws require that the\n",
      "examination of baggage shall be conducted 'liberally, and with prudence\n",
      "and moderation,' and certainly we have no occasion to complain of\n",
      "discourtesy. In addition to clothing 'not excessive in quantity,' a\n",

      "one or two pistols with equipments and cartridges, one hundred cigars,\n",
      "forty small packages of cigarettes, a rifle or fowling-piece, one pound\n",

      "in the Civil War fifteen years later, and now in use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will explain that,\" said the Doctor, and he did so in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After peace had been declared and our army returned from Mexico, the\n",

      "was taken in the matter until Jefferson Davis was Secretary of War,\n",
      "between 1853 and 1857; and I will here remark that Jefferson Davis\n",
      "commanded a regiment of Mississippi Volunteers during the Mexican War,\n",
      "and fought in this very battle of Monterey we have just been talking\n",
      "about. Well, Mr. Davis sent a circular letter to the officers of the\n",

      "subject before anything else. In a short time after receiving the\n",
      "circular he sent a variety of suggestions to the Department which were\n",
      "very funny, to say the least.\n",

      "\"He designed a hat which, in addition to covering the head, could be\n",

      "there was a picture representing it applied to each of its proposed\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Instead of the shoulder cross-belts, he proposed that the soldier\n",
      "should have a leather belt around his waist, and to this belt should be\n",
      "attached a stout hook with a shank six inches long, and the point of the\n",
      "hook standing outward from the man's back. On this hook the soldier\n",
      "could hang his knapsack or equipments when on the march. He could be\n",
      "harnessed by means of it so as to drag a wagon or a cannon; and in an\n",
      "assault on a fortress he could be made to drag a scaling-ladder up the\n",
      "walls by means of this hook. Derby also proposed that the officers\n",
      "should be provided with poles like rake-handles, ten or twelve feet\n",
      "long, with rings at one end, and if a soldier should try to run away in\n",
      "battle he could be dragged back to duty by means of the hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Derby was skilful with the pencil, and he sent a sketch of a\n",
      "battle-field in which the various uses of the hook were depicted. To say\n",
      "that Jefferson Davis was angry when he read the letter is to put the\n",
      "case mildly; he turned red and blue with rage, and took the document to\n",
      "a cabinet meeting that was being held on the afternoon of the day he\n",
      "received Derby's communication. The members of the cabinet laughed over\n",
      "the suggestions and pictures, and when Davis declared he would have\n",
      "Derby cashiered for disrespect to the Secretary of War, they advised him\n",
      "to say nothing. 'If the story gets out,' said one of them, 'you'll be\n",
      "the laughingstock of the country from one end to the other, and will\n",

      "\"Mr. Davis cooled down, and the story didn't come out until years\n",

      "that it is cooler than other places in the same latitude but at a lower\n",

      "On resuming their journey through Mexico, Doctor Bronson and his young\n",

      "\n",
      "As they passed Santa Caterina, eight or ten miles beyond Monterey, one\n",
      "of their fellow-passengers told them that there were some interesting\n",
      "caves not very far from the station, and also near Garcia, thirteen\n",
      "miles farther on. A remarkable hole in the mountain near Santa Caterina\n",
      "was pointed out by the same gentleman, but in spite of his voluble\n",
      "account of the attractive features of a journey there, they did not\n",
      "consent to stop for the excursion. They also decided to allow the caves\n",
      "of Garcia to take care of themselves, much to the disappointment of\n",
      "their informant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of the scenery along the railway, almost from the very moment\n",
      "of leaving Monterey, kept their eyes busy on both sides of the train.\n",
      "The railway for some distance follows the San Juan Valley, which\n",
      "diminishes in width as it ascends. The labored puffing of the locomotive\n",
      "told that the grade was a steep one, and it was evident that the engine\n",
      "was exerting all its powers. On most trains two locomotives are\n",
      "required, and an extra one is always added unless the number of\n",
      "carriages is small and their cargoes are light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scenery of the Sierra Madre is remarkably fine, and surpassed by\n",
      "that of very few railway routes in the world. Frank compared it to that\n",
      "of the Brenner or Semmering passes of the Alps, and Fred said he was\n",
      "reminded of the Blue Mountains in Australia, and the route traversed by\n",
      "the railway between Colombo and Kandy, in Ceylon. But they agreed that\n",
      "it differed in some respects from all these routes, and had a beauty\n",
      "and grandeur of its own, just as did each of the places they had\n",
      "mentioned. On each side of the valley the mountains rose very steeply,\n",
      "and in many places they were nearly, if not quite, perpendicular. The\n",
      "rocks were of various shades, in which red had a prominent place, and on\n",
      "the steepest part of the slopes there was no place where vegetation\n",
      "could cling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best of the scenery was in the neighborhood of Garcia; beyond that\n",
      "point it became less grand, as the mountains were farther away in the\n",
      "widening valley, and the steep cliffs were less numerous. But the\n",
      "ascent was steady, and brought the train to the plateau and to a much\n",
      "higher elevation than that of Monterey. Monterey, as before stated, is\n",
      "1800 feet above sea-level; Saltillo is at an elevation of 5200 feet, and\n",
      "consequently the railway ascends 3400 feet in passing from the former to\n",
      "the latter city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old route of the diligence before the railway was built afforded an\n",
      "exciting ride from San Gregario to Rinconada, as the descent was very\n",
      "rapid and the coach went down the incline with great rapidity. At one\n",
      "turn in the road there was a point where a misstep would have sent the\n",
      "whole conveyance down a precipitous slope of a thousand feet into the\n",
      "valley below. A thoughtful American who travelled that route years ago\n",
      "regarded the possibilities of such a slide, and estimated that the\n",
      "diligence, passengers and all, would be worth not more than nineteen\n",
      "cents a bushel after making the descent into the yawning gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: THE ORGAN CACTUS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank and Fred wished they could gather some of the bright\n",
      "cactus-flowers which abounded along the route. There are many varieties\n",
      "of cactus in Mexico; in fact the country may be said to be the land of\n",
      "the cacti. Botanists have described more than sixty species; they vary\n",
      "in height and size from the little plant hardly larger than a spray of\n",
      "clover up to the gigantic growths that rise more than thirty feet above\n",
      "the ground. The flowers run from pure white to a deep scarlet and\n",
      "purple, and some of the flowers are of great beauty. A peculiarity of\n",
      "the cactus is that it thrives best in poor soils, and on a great part of\n",
      "the ground where it grows few other vegetable products could maintain an\n",
      "existence. The largest of the cactus family is scientifically known as\n",
      "the _Candelabrum_, but the Mexicans call it the _Organo_, or organ; it\n",
      "grows in straight hexagonal columns, and when many of these columns are\n",
      "clustered together it bears quite a resemblance to a church organ with\n",
      "its pipes. One variety of cactus nourishes the cochineal insect; another\n",
      "is used for hedges, and owing to the sharp spines for which the plant is\n",
      "noted, it forms an impervious barrier to man or quadruped. The cactus\n",
      "generally has inside its flower a mass of edible substance, and in some\n",
      "localities this cactus-fruit is collected and sold in the markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: VARIETIES OF CACTUS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The cactus plant is not wholly inedible, as the donkeys of Mexico feed\n",
      "on some of them, and the goat will also make a meal of the leaves and\n",
      "stalks. But this is not to be wondered at when it is borne in mind that\n",
      "the goat is popularly credited with dining upon tomato-cans, scraps of\n",
      "tin, old boots, newspapers, umbrellas, and other articles not ordinarily\n",
      "included among esculents. Of late years the cactus has been found useful\n",
      "for paper-making, and thousands of tons of it are annually converted\n",
      "into paper fibre.\n",

      "A little past eight o'clock in the evening the train rolled into\n",
      "Saltillo, a city containing from fifteen to twenty thousand inhabitants,\n",
      "the capital of the State of Cohahuila, and for some years the terminus\n",
      "of the National Railway. There are several cotton factories at Saltillo\n",
      "or in its immediate vicinity, and the place boasts of its serapes.\n",
      "Evidently the boast is justified, as the serapes of Saltillo have a\n",
      "reputation all through northern Mexico. Our friends improved the\n",
      "opportunity to provide themselves with these needed articles of Mexican\n",
      "travel, and through the rest of their journey they carried their\n",
      "souvenirs of Saltillo and were well satisfied with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been advised to go to the Hotel Tomasichi, but with the\n",
      "condition that they must not expect anything remarkable in the way of a\n",
      "hotel. The Doctor secured a carriage which was so rickety that it\n",
      "threatened dissolution before reaching the Plaza Mayor, where the hotel\n",
      "is situated, but by good-fortune it held together and landed them\n",
      "safely. The proprietor of the hotel told them that there was only one\n",
      "good carriage in the city, and if they wanted it for the next day it\n",
      "would be well to order it at once. It belonged to Señor Sada, the owner\n",
      "of the diligence that would take them to Jaral, where it connected with\n",
      "the trains on the International Railway. The advice was taken, and the\n",
      "one good carriage of Saltillo was ordered for the next day's driving in\n",
      "and around the city. Six reals, or seventy-five cents, an hour was the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The peso, or dollar, is divided into eight reals or reales, of the\n",

      "and 4 reals a toston (50 cents). Values are reckoned in centavos (100\n",
      "centavos make 1 peso), reals, or pesos until large sums are reached,\n",
      "when they are counted in gold. Of gold coins there are the escudito de\n",

      "de oro (gold ounce), $16.\"\n",

      "American currency can be used without difficulty in the large cities,\n",

      "Mexico, and South America can be carried in place of silver, which is\n",
      "inconveniently heavy; but our friends were advised not to rely upon\n",

      "Doctor Bronson told the youths that a metric system of coinage was\n",
      "established some years ago, but the common people were prejudiced\n",
      "against it, and it had made comparatively little progress. Half and\n",

      "Mexican and Italian cookery, Tomasichi being an Italian and his cook a\n",
      "native of Mexico. The chief had instructed the subordinate in the ways\n",
      "of the kitchens of Rome and Naples, but not sufficiently to drive out\n",
      "the ideas of the land of the Aztecs. Stimulated by curiosity and also by\n",
      "a good appetite, the Doctor and his nephews made an excellent meal, or\n",
      "at least it was good enough to make them wish to taste a dinner entirely\n",
      "Mexican in character. We will see later on how they succeeded in their\n",
      "experiment.\n",

      "The next morning they started in good season to inspect the city and its\n",
      "surroundings. They found the Alameda much prettier than that of\n",
      "Monterey, and some travellers have pronounced it the most attractive one\n",
      "to be found in Mexico. The inhabitants are deservedly proud of it. It is\n",
      "a popular resort at all hours, and especially in the evening, when\n",
      "everybody goes out for a promenade. The Plaza Mayor is also an\n",
      "attractive spot, and the youths wished to make a sketch of it from the\n",

      "The building where they were received was in the form of a hollow\n",
      "square, like the houses of Monterey, already described. The entrance was\n",
      "sufficiently broad to permit the admission of vehicles, and the carriage\n",
      "was driven inside before the travellers alighted. According to Mexican\n",
      "custom, a _mozo_, or servant, had been sent in advance to give notice of\n",
      "the advent of the strangers and have the house in readiness. The\n",
      "visitors were shown to rooms on the lower floor; the Doctor was assigned\n",
      "to a room by himself, while the boys were lodged together in a large\n",
      "room very meagrely furnished. The beds were straw-filled mattresses,\n",
      "laid upon strips of rawhide stretched tightly across a frame, and the\n",
      "boys pronounced it an excellent substitute for some of the \"patent\n",
      "spring mattresses\" which are sold in American cities. The linen was\n",
      "scrupulously clean, which is not always the case in Mexico, but the\n",

      "\"To judge by the difference between the rooms of the hacienda and the\n",

      "stable is certainly better ventilated, and the horses have no reason to\n",

      "The first thing to attract Frank's attention was a woman kneeling on the\n",
      "floor over a flat stone raised at one end, on which she was rolling some\n",
      "dough into very thin sheets. \"That must be a tortilla-maker,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "From his observation at this kitchen, and from subsequent information,\n",
      "the youth made the following note:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MAKING TORTILLAS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tortillas, or cakes, are made from corn-meal, which is ground by hand\n",
      "on a flat stone called a _metate_, a word of Aztec origin. The corn is\n",
      "soaked in lime-water till the hull can be separated from it, and then it\n",
      "is pounded and rolled upon the metate until it is ground into meal. In\n",
      "this work the woman uses a cylinder of stone something like the American\n",
      "rolling-pin, or very often she uses a flat or slightly rounded stone,\n",
      "with which she pounds and twists for hours. When the meal is\n",
      "sufficiently ground a little water is added, and it is worked into\n",
      "dough; the dough is then rolled or patted in the hand until it is almost\n",
      "as thin as a knife-blade and formed into circular cakes. The cakes are\n",
      "baked on an iron _comal_, or griddle, which has been previously held\n",
      "over the fire until it is so hot that the cooking is done in a few\n",
      "moments. They are not allowed to brown, and are best when served hot.\n",
      "They are generally without salt or other seasoning, and are very\n",
      "tasteless at first to a stranger; but after one has become accustomed to\n",
      "tortillas he prefers them to any other kind of corn-cake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The equipment of the kitchen was exceedingly simple, and the youths\n",
      "wondered how a French cook would get along with none but Mexican\n",
      "utensils to get up a meal with. The stove, or cooking range, consisted\n",
      "simply of a wall or bank of solid adobe about two feet high, and of the\n",
      "same width; this bank was built up against one side of the kitchen,\n",
      "which was ten or twelve feet square, and it extended the whole length of\n",
      "that side. There were depressions in the bank, in which small fires of\n",
      "charcoal or wood were burning; on these fires the pots, pans, and\n",
      "griddles were placed, and the process of cooking went on. There was no\n",
      "chimney, the smoke escaping, or being supposed to escape, through an\n",
      "opening in the roof directly over the cooking range.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A PRIMITIVE KITCHEN.]\n",
      "\n",
      "But the kitchen of the common people is less elaborate than this. It\n",
      "consists simply of a mound of clay, perhaps a foot in height and a yard\n",
      "in diameter, and depressed in the centre. Little fires in this\n",
      "depression furnish the heat for cooking the food placed in the pots and\n",
      "kettles, which are of common unglazed earthen-ware. The cook sits or\n",
      "squats on the floor close by this primitive range, while the mistress of\n",
      "the kitchen previously described stands, and can walk about at will\n",
      "without the trouble of rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some parts of Mexico the cooking is done out-of-doors. This is\n",
      "particularly the case in the southern portion, and in the season of\n",
      "rains the weather often reduces culinary operations to a very limited\n",
      "quantity. The more rain the less dinner, unless the food is eaten raw;\n",
      "but as it consists largely of fruits, the inconvenience is less serious\n",
      "than it might be otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our young friends went to dinner they found a repast that was\n",
      "entirely Mexican in character. After it was over they made notes of what\n",
      "they had seen and eaten, and this was the result:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had tortillas, of course, and very good they were. The dinner began\n",
      "with a soup, which was so good that we asked how it was made, as we\n",

      "they told us:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'We start this soup with a chicken broth just as chicken broth is made\n",
      "anywhere else. Then we take the meat of the chicken, the white part\n",
      "only, after it has been boiled very tender, and pick it into little bits\n",
      "of shreds. We take some pounded almonds, the yolks of hard-boiled eggs,\n",
      "a little bread which has been soaked in milk, a little spice of some\n",
      "kind, and plenty of pepper, and we mix the whole up together till it\n",
      "forms a hard paste. We make this paste into little balls and drop them\n",

      "It was found that the name was derived from a tribe of Indians called\n",
      "Zacatecas, and also from a grass that grows there, and is known in\n",
      "Mexico as _zacate_. It should be remembered that the city is the capital\n",
      "of the State of Zacatecas. As it stands in a ravine, where very little\n",
      "grass of any kind can grow, it is probable that the appellation, so far\n",

      "which is the centre of the silver-mining district.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city, which has a population of about 30,000, is anything but\n",
      "attractive, as its position in a deep ravine makes its streets very\n",
      "narrow, and crowds the buildings closely together. Its streets are badly\n",
      "paved, and it is so poorly supplied with water that the drains are not\n",
      "properly washed. Frank thought it averaged a distinct and different\n",
      "smell for each thousand of its inhabitants, and the youths were not\n",
      "surprised to learn that the mortality, especially among the poorer part\n",
      "of the population, is very great. The mountains rise all around and\n",
      "above the city, and the extent of the silver business is shown by the\n",
      "large number of buildings on the mountainsides, which mark the\n",
      "reduction-works and the entrances to the mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a ridge called the _Bufa_, or Buffalo, overlooking the city; it\n",

      "than a century and a half ago, and was at one time a favorite place of\n",
      "pilgrimage. Ordinary offenders were required to do penance by ascending\n",
      "on foot to the door of the chapel, and extraordinary ones made the\n",
      "journey on their knees. The custom still prevails, though less so than\n",
      "formerly. Frank and Fred saw several pilgrims making the ascent, but\n",
      "were told that days, and even weeks, might elapse before another scene\n",
      "of the same sort could be witnessed.\n",

      "Government, and are not likely to be restored. It is said that the\n",
      "baptismal font was of solid silver, and worth $100,000. The Jesuits have\n",

      "were not long in finding the silver deposits of the New World. During\n",
      "the sixteenth century the mines of Mexico were extensively worked, and\n",
      "the working continued steadily down to the war for independence, when it\n",
      "greatly fell off. At the time of Humboldt's visit, in 1803, about 3000\n",
      "distinct mines were in operation; Humboldt estimated that the product\n",
      "of silver in Mexico from the Conquest, in 1521, down to 1804 amounted to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Roughly estimated, the weight of that value in silver would be\n",
      "333,000,000 pounds, or 166,000 tons, estimating 2000 pounds to the ton.\n",
      "If we had it in the City of Mexico we would have to engage 416 trains of\n",
      "forty cars each, with ten tons of silver in each car, to take it to Vera\n",

      "\"Well,\" said Fred, \"there's one thing you've forgotten; remember that\n",
      "the most of this silver has been brought from the mines on the backs of\n",
      "mules or donkeys. Reckoning 100 pounds to a load, how many burros would\n",
      "be needed to transport our fortune, supposing we had it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank figured again, and found that the silver product of Mexico from\n",
      "the Conquest to the present time would load three and a third million\n",
      "burros; putting them in single file, and allowing each burro ten feet of\n",
      "space, there would be 631 miles of them, and half a mile or so over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's go into the business of silver-mining,\" said Fred; \"just see\n",
      "what a lot of money has been made by it, and with very crude methods of\n",
      "reducing the ore! With the improved processes of modern times there must\n",
      "be a fortune for everybody.\"\n",

      "should think twice before venturing into it. \"And so far as the Mexican\n",
      "mines are concerned,\" he said, \"there are very few of them that are\n",
      "doing more than paying working expenses, and some do not do that. Fifty\n",
      "or more American companies are engaged in this country at present; a few\n",

      "put into their enterprises, or any interest upon it. And unless I am\n",
      "misinformed, it is next to impossible to buy a good mine here; if a\n",
      "Mexican has a mine he is willing to sell, you may be pretty sure it\n",
      "isn't worth buying. The same rule holds good in all mining regions the\n",
      "world over, and is hardly necessary to discuss. The mining laws of\n",
      "Mexico require that the owner of a mine must work it for four\n",
      "consecutive months in each year, with four regular miners, under\n",
      "penalty of forfeiture. Unless he complies with this law the mine\n",

      "government, and that he (Diaz) should be commander-in-chief of the army\n",
      "until the assembly had done its work. This would have been practically\n",

      "corpulent, exceedingly plain in dress, but always fastidiously neat.\n",
      "Ordinarily he wore a dress-coat of black broadcloth, with other garments\n",
      "to match, and on state occasions he substituted white gloves and cravat\n",
      "for the every-day black ones. He used to ride in a plain coach, with no\n",

      "a priest of the Aztec temple at Taos, in New Mexico, kindled a fire upon\n",
      "its altar, and planted a tree in front of the edifice. He prophesied\n",
      "that when the tree died a new white race would come from the East and\n",
      "conquer the land, and when the fire went out a new Montezuma would arise\n",
      "and rule Mexico. The tree died in 1846, during our war with Mexico, and\n",

      "authorities warned all good Catholics not to invest in it. The result\n",
      "was that it went at very low prices, and fell into the hands of those\n",
      "who cared nothing for the religion of the former owners. The Church\n",
      "people probably see by this time that they made a mistake. Had they\n",

      "small valuation. Dwelling-houses, shops, and all sorts of ordinary\n",
      "buildings, along with the rural estates and the convents, have been sold\n",
      "for secular purposes, but the church edifices proper are permitted to\n",
      "remain in the hands of their former authorities, and services go on\n",

      "From the windows of the car they shuddered as they looked into the cut,\n",
      "and wondered if never an accident had happened from the falling away of\n",
      "the earth. The cut is twelve and a half miles in length, and is the work\n",
      "of human hands, not of nature. The railway enters the valley of Mexico\n",
      "through this cut, and the track is laid on a shelf or bench along its\n",
      "sides and high above the bottom. Our friends visited it a few days\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The city of Mexico stands in a valley which has no outlet, the water\n",
      "that accumulates from the rains being evaporated by the heat of the sun\n",
      "or absorbed in the volcanic soil. The city is in the lowest part of the\n",
      "valley, and is therefore liable to be overflowed whenever the\n",
      "evaporation and absorption are not sufficient to carry off the water\n",
      "that accumulates. There are several lakes that cover a tenth part of the\n",
      "area of the valley. The lowest of them is salt, as it has no outlet, but\n",
      "the others which discharge into it are fresh. This salt lake is called\n",
      "Tezcoco. It has an area of seventy-seven square miles, and its surface\n",
      "ordinarily is only two feet lower than the level of the Plaza Mayor, or\n",
      "great square of the city. In the days of the Aztecs the lake surrounded\n",
      "the city, but it is now three miles away from it, owing to the recession\n",
      "of the waters. Lake Chalco is three and a half feet higher than Tezcoco;\n",
      "while Zumpango, the most northerly of all the lakes, is twenty-nine feet\n",
      "higher than the Plaza Mayor. The lakes are separated by dikes, some of\n",
      "which were built by the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards, but\n",
      "the greater number are of more recent construction, as we shall\n",
      "presently see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, it is evident that an unusual flood of water could raise Tezcoco\n",
      "so that it would flood the city, and this is what has happened on five\n",
      "different occasions--in 1553, 1580, 1604, 1607, and 1629. The last\n",
      "inundation continued for five years, and caused an immense amount of\n",
      "suffering and loss. The city was covered to a depth of three feet, and\n",
      "the waters were finally carried off by an earthquake, which allowed them\n",
      "to run away through the crevices that it formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's where we come to the history of the great cut of Nochistongo.\n",
      "The Spanish Government consulted all the celebrated engineers of the\n",
      "day, and they presented numerous plans for draining the city and\n",
      "keeping it out of danger from inundations. Enrico Martinez presented the\n",
      "plan which was adopted. It was to drain Lake Zumpango so that its waters\n",
      "would not be poured into Tezcoco, but would run to the Gulf of Mexico by\n",
      "way of Tula. For this purpose he proposed to make a tunnel through\n",
      "Nochistongo, to carry off the superfluous water of Zumpango, or, rather,\n",
      "of the river Cuatitlan, which flows into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: YOUNG GIRLS OF TULA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tunnel was commenced in November, 1607, but when completed it was\n",
      "found insufficient to drain the lake, and a new plan was needed. A Dutch\n",
      "engineer was then brought in, and he naturally proposed a system of\n",
      "dikes, similar to those of his own country and the dikes already built\n",
      "by the Aztecs. He was allowed to carry out his scheme until the arrival\n",
      "of a new viceroy in 1628. The new viceroy would not believe the accounts\n",
      "which he heard of the floods that had occurred, and he ordered Martinez\n",
      "to stop up the tunnel and allow the waters to take their original\n",
      "course. He was soon convinced of his error, and ordered the tunnel to be\n",
      "reopened. It was reopened and continued in use until the following June,\n",
      "when Martinez found that it was being destroyed by the pressure of the\n",
      "water, and he therefore closed it to save it from ruin. A disastrous\n",
      "flood followed, and this was the one that lasted five years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did the people get around in that time?\" Fred asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were forced to use boats,\" was the reply; \"but the getting about\n",
      "was the least part of the trouble caused by the flood. Most of the\n",
      "houses were of adobe, and these soon crumbled and fell. The loss was so\n",
      "great that the Spanish Government ordered the site of the city to be\n",
      "changed to higher ground, but on representations by the City Council of\n",
      "the value of the permanent structures which would thus be rendered\n",
      "useless, the order was countermanded. The city was restored after the\n",
      "subsidence of the waters. It has been threatened several times since,\n",
      "but though it has been in great danger the cut and the dikes have saved\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how about the making of the tunnel into a cut?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They put Martinez in prison as soon as the flood came, and he was kept\n",
      "there for several years. Then it was determined to change the tunnel\n",
      "into a cut, and he was released and put in charge of the work. It took\n",
      "150 years to make it, and though nominally finished in 1789, it has\n",
      "never been entirely completed. Thousands of Indians died during the work\n",
      "of digging this enormous ditch. It was the greatest earthwork of its\n",
      "time, and in fact the greatest down to the cutting of the Suez and\n",
      "Panama canals. Here are the figures:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Length of the cut, 67,537 feet; greatest depth, 197 feet; greatest\n",
      "breadth, 361 feet. The original tunnel of Martinez was four miles long,\n",
      "eleven and a half feet wide, and fourteen feet high. Portions of the old\n",
      "tunnel, or rather of its ruins, are visible to-day. There is a monument\n",
      "to the memory of Martinez, which was erected a few years ago in one of\n",
      "the public squares of the capital city; it might possibly console him\n",

      "As Frank paused, Doctor Bronson took up the subject and said that even\n",
      "with the waters of Zumpango drained away there was still a liability of\n",
      "the overflow of the lower lakes. He added that numerous projects had\n",
      "been proposed. Some engineers were in favor of drying up Tezcoco\n",
      "altogether by turning away the waters that flow into it; others advised\n",
      "draining the waters into a lower part of the valley, if such could be\n",
      "found; and others again proposed a long and large tunnel through the\n",
      "mountains at so low a level that Tezcoco and the city could be\n",
      "thoroughly drained. To this should be added a canal from the upper lakes\n",

      "\"What will be done about it no one can safely predict,\" the Doctor\n",

      "Tezcoco, which is becoming dirtier and more shallow every year. No plan\n",
      "has been proposed that has been pronounced successful, or to which there\n",
      "is not a serious objection. Of course almost anything could be done with\n",
      "unlimited money, but Mexico, like other cities and countries, has a\n",

      "\n",
      "The smells that greeted the nostrils of the youths on their arrival at\n",

      "than in the very high region where it is (7602 feet above the sea), it\n",

      "we go first to the cathedral.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a magnificent building, and would do honor to any of the capitals\n",
      "of Europe. The spot where it stands is historic; the Spaniards destroyed\n",
      "the Aztec city that stood here, and built their own upon its ruins, and\n",
      "where now stands the cathedral the Teocalli, or temple of the Aztecs,\n",
      "was formerly to be seen. It is saddening to think of the rivers of blood\n",
      "that flowed here in the sacrifices which the Aztecs deemed necessary to\n",
      "their religious exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The historical authorities say generally that 60,000 persons were\n",
      "slaughtered in a single year on the altars of the Great Teocalli of\n",
      "Tenochtitlan (the Aztec city that stood here and was destroyed by the\n",
      "Spaniards); most of them were prisoners of war, but when there was not a\n",
      "sufficient supply of prisoners the Aztecs themselves were chosen for\n",
      "sacrifice. The Spaniards may have shown great cruelty in their treatment\n",
      "of the people they conquered, but they did well to put a stop to this\n",
      "terrible shedding of blood in the name of religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Teocalli was a pyramid of earth, faced with stone, and is said to\n",
      "have been 150 feet in height. Steps led around and up its sides, and\n",
      "they were so arranged that in mounting to the top the pedestrian made a\n",
      "complete circuit of the structure. On the summit was the sacrificial\n",
      "altar, and this is supposed to have been very nearly where the centre of\n",
      "the cathedral is at present. The sacrificial stone from the Teocalli is\n",
      "now in the museum; it is shaped like a millstone, is three feet high by\n",
      "nine in diameter, and is elaborately carved on the sides and upper\n",

      "it. The Teocalli was destroyed, and the materials were used for filling\n",
      "up the neighboring canal; then a small church was erected, and followed\n",
      "by a larger one, and this again was removed in 1573 to make room for the\n",
      "present cathedral, which was completed ninety-four years later at an\n",
      "expense of $2,000,000. It stands on the eastern side of the Plaza Mayor,\n",
      "and is a very conspicuous object in the panorama of the city. Like most\n",
      "Catholic cathedrals, it is in the shape of a cross, its greatest length\n",
      "being 426 feet, and its greatest width 200 feet. It is 175 feet high,\n",
      "and its towers rise to a height of 200 feet. We ascended to the top\n",
      "of one of the towers, and advise all visitors to the city to do\n",

      "\"As we looked from the tower we agreed with Bishop Haven that never did\n",
      "a city have such an environment. The whole city lay below us spread out\n",
      "like a map; there are few chimneys in Mexico, and consequently there was\n",
      "no smoke to mar the view, and we readily traced the streets and avenues,\n",
      "stippled with the green of the squares and gardens that abound so\n",
      "numerously. We looked over the plains and down upon the lakes, and then\n",
      "our gaze swept to the mountains that surround the valley in a jagged\n",
      "chain that covers nearly 200 miles of distance in its girdling course.\n",
      "The snow-covered peaks of Popocatepetl and his sister and companion,\n",
      "'The White Woman,' seemed to rise higher than we had before seen them,\n",
      "and added a solemnity to the picture in addition to that which it\n",
      "already possessed. North of the city rises the hill on which is built\n",
      "the Church of Guadalupe, and on the west is that of Chapultepec. As we\n",
      "looked on the latter we thought of the heroic attack upon the fortress\n",

      "the walls alone; at one time the wealth of the church, in silver and\n",
      "gold and costly pictures, was something almost beyond calculation, but\n",
      "it has been repeatedly plundered, and the aggregate work of the\n",
      "despoilers has stripped off much of its magnificence, but even now it is\n",
      "very rich, and as long as peace continues is likely to remain so. There\n",
      "are six altars, fourteen chapels, and five naves; there are paintings by\n",
      "famous artists of Spain, and there is a balustrade around the choir\n",
      "which is said to weigh 50,000 pounds, and is so valuable that the church\n",
      "authorities refused an offer to replace it with a balustrade of solid\n",
      "silver of equal weight. The balustrade was made in Macao, China, and is\n",

      "days later he was shot by order of the military commander; as he fell he\n",

      "they were so heavy as to make a load for a strong man, and some were so\n",
      "large that the strength of one man was not sufficient to raise them. The\n",

      "studded with diamonds, pearls, amethysts, sapphires, emeralds, and\n",

      "has the pupils of his eyes turned upward, and they are seen through the\n",
      "sacred mask that covers the upper part of his face. The hieroglyphics\n",
      "on the diadem encircling the head represent the division of time and\n",
      "the Mexican method of numbering the years. The civil year, like ours,\n",
      "was 365 days. Each four years had different emblems repeated\n",
      "successively, without reference to other chronological arrangements. The\n",
      "first year was called _tochtl_, or rabbit; the second, _acatl_, or reed;\n",
      "the third, _tecpatl_, or flint; the fourth, _calli_, or house. In\n",
      "addition to these periods, the years were arranged by the number of\n",
      "thirteen, four of such periods making fifty-two years, or a Mexican age,\n",
      "when the Festival of Fire occurred. This was a most serious event for\n",
      "the Mexicans, as the priests taught the people that the world might come\n",
      "to an end and terrible demons would descend from above and eat up\n",
      "mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'The two claws on the dial at the sides of the mask represent\n",
      "computations of numbers, for which the hand was used in a sort of\n",
      "deaf-and-dumb alphabet. The large V-shaped ornaments denote four equal\n",
      "divisions of the day, and the smaller ornaments of the same shape\n",
      "indicate the division of the day into eight parts. The ornaments lying\n",
      "between the V's represent eight divisions of the night. The twenty\n",
      "ornaments in panels in the circle inside the V's are symbols of twenty\n",

      "the people, who had never seen such an animal. All burdens were carried\n",
      "on men's backs, and they had towers erected along the principal roads\n",
      "for forwarding the King's despatches. These towers were about six miles\n",
      "apart, and couriers were always standing ready to receive messages\n",

      "how to temper it so as to make it nearly as hard as steel. They used it\n",
      "for many of their implements, but they also had great skill in the use\n",
      "of implements of stone, flint, obsidian, and other minerals. They knew\n",
      "about lead and tin, but made little use of them, copper being their only\n",

      "very old. They make none of these things now, but confine themselves to\n",
      "pictures on cards, where the feathers are made to adhere by means of\n",
      "paste or wax. Each feather is handled separately, and none of the skin\n",

      "the estimated value of his goods at an interest varying from three to\n",
      "twelve and a half per cent. per annum. He must renew his tickets every\n",
      "eight months, and when he ceases to pay interest upon his loans the\n",
      "goods are kept for seven months, and then offered for sale at an\n",
      "appraiser's valuation. If there is no offer for them in one month, the\n",
      "appraisement is reduced, and then they are offered for another month.\n",
      "The performance is repeated monthly for six months, and then the goods\n",

      "\"Anything and everything of any value may be pawned here, and the vaults\n",
      "have contained at different times money, jewels, and precious metals\n",

      "two friends who were to indorse his paper and 'go his security.' The\n",
      "official into whose hands they fell said the establishment would make\n",

      "say it is toothsome, and many a stranger has devoured axolotl under the\n",
      "name of fried eel, and enjoyed it too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a great deal in a name and in prejudice,\" was the youth's\n",
      "commentary as he changed the subject to something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "That something was a peculiar article of food even stranger than\n",
      "axolotl. Its scientific name is _Ahuatlea Mexicana_, and it consists of\n",
      "the eggs of a peculiar fly, which are deposited on the reeds and rushes\n",
      "growing in the shallow places along the borders of the lake. A traveller\n",
      "who visited Mexico two and a half centuries ago wrote of this substance\n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Indians gathered much of this and kept it in Heaps, and made\n",
      "thereof Cakes like unto Brick-bats, and they did eat this with as good a\n",
      "Stomach as we eat Cheese; yea, and they hold Opinion that this Scum, or\n",
      "Fatness, of the Water is the Cause that such great number of Fowl cometh\n",
      "to the Lake, which in the winter Season is infinite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Custom has not changed in two hundred and fifty years. They sell these\n",
      "\"cakes like unto brick-bats\" in the markets of Mexico to-day, and the\n",
      "Indians eat the stuff with good relish. It bears some resemblance to\n",
      "fine fish-roe; and after all, prejudice again being removed, and one\n",
      "being hungry, it is not bad eating. The Indians gather these insects by\n",
      "myriads and pound them into paste, which is afterwards wrapped in\n",
      "corn-husks, and forms an article of food second only to the one just\n",
      "mentioned. The laying capacity of the insect, which is about the size of\n",
      "an ordinary fly, is something marvellous, surpassing the abilities of\n",
      "the choicest fowls that ever were reared.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he's playing the bear!\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what is 'playing the bear?' I would like to know,\" the youth\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's making love,\" the guide explained; \"that's the Mexican way of\n",
      "courtship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a subject of special interest to the youths, as they knew their\n",
      "sisters and all the other young ladies at home would wish to know about\n",
      "it. Accordingly, they proceeded to inform themselves concerning the\n",
      "Mexican form of wooing, and here is the result of their inquiries:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Courtship in this country,\" wrote Frank, \"is a serious matter, and\n",
      "requires a great deal of patience. Young ladies are carefully secluded\n",
      "from anything more than the most formal acquaintance with young men, and\n",
      "there is no such thing here as the freedom of social manners that we\n",
      "have at home. When a young man has fixed his thoughts upon a fair damsel\n",
      "whom he has met at a party, or to whom he has been introduced in the\n",
      "Zocalo, he begins his courtship by walking up and down the street in\n",
      "front of her house and keeping his eyes fixed on one of the balconies,\n",
      "which he has somehow ascertained is the proper one for his gaze. A hint\n",
      "has been conveyed to the young lady that he will be there, and also to\n",
      "her parents and sisters. This hint may be given by the priest, who\n",
      "frequently serves as an intermediary; by some relative of the young man;\n",
      "or by means of a note sent to the young lady herself through the medium\n",
      "of the _portero_, or door-keeper, whose trouble must be paid for with\n",
      "cash in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MEXICAN COURTSHIP.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This promenading in front of the house is kept up for hours at a time\n",
      "day after day, and also at night, and is what is called 'playing the\n",
      "bear.' It is generally done on foot, but sometimes the lover appears on\n",
      "horseback, the lady having been notified, through the subsidized\n",
      "portero, at what hour he may be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: CODE-SIGNALLING WITH THE FAN.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lover is observed by the lady and her mother and the other feminine\n",
      "members of the family, who sit inside the window and are partially, if\n",
      "not wholly, screened from sight. If the match is favored by the parents\n",
      "the 'bear business' lasts only a month, or perhaps two or three months;\n",
      "but if it is not so favored the lover may keep it up for a long time, or\n",
      "until he gets discouraged and withdraws his suit. Of course it happens\n",
      "here as in other countries that parental opposition occasionally\n",
      "develops the young lady's affection, and then the young couple resort to\n",
      "all sorts of stratagems to exchange _billets-doux_. Letters are raised\n",
      "or lowered by means of strings, or transmitted through the hands of the\n",
      "portero already mentioned. In the case of parental opposition the\n",
      "portero runs a great risk, and consequently must be highly paid.\n",
      "Courtship under such circumstances is a luxury that only the affluent\n",
      "can afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the proper time arrives, provided everything is running smoothly,\n",
      "the young man, accompanied by a gentleman friend older than himself,\n",
      "calls on the father of the girl, and makes a proposal for her hand. The\n",
      "father says he will see about it, and the visitors take their leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The father asks the girl if she desires to marry the young man. However\n",
      "much she may desire to do so she must profess indifference and say she\n",
      "cannot tell until she has met him. Then he is invited to call, and when\n",
      "he responds he is met by the entire family, including the servants.\n",
      "After he becomes the _novio oficial_, or accepted lover, he has the\n",
      "privilege of calling without a friend; but at no time is he ever left\n",
      "for a moment alone with the young lady. All interviews must be in the\n",
      "presence of a member of the family or of a duenna, no matter how long\n",
      "the courtship may continue after the formal acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"THERE HE IS.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As the time for the marriage ceremony approaches the groom has a\n",
      "serious matter to contemplate--the 'matter o' money' connected with\n",
      "matrimony. He must furnish the house and home, and also buy the bridal\n",
      "outfit. Not infrequently the parents of the bride relieve him of a part\n",
      "of the expense, though they allow him to buy the jewels and bridal\n",
      "dresses. One thing that he must provide, according to a\n",
      "long-established custom, is an ivory-covered prayer-book; whatever else\n",
      "he fails in he must not be negligent in this. Eight or ten weeks before\n",
      "the ceremony, the pair must register at church, giving their names,\n",
      "ages, etc., very much as they do in some of the American States. A\n",
      "similar registry is made at the civil office. The banns must be\n",
      "published for five Sundays, and the bride must state before the priest\n",
      "and a notary that she marries 'of her own free-will.' The civil marriage\n",
      "takes place a few days before the ceremony in the church, and when the\n",
      "matter is ended the young couple are fairly launched into wedded life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hadn't you better say something,\" Fred remarked, \"about the ceremony\n",
      "itself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's hardly necessary,\" replied Frank, \"as it is not much unlike the\n",
      "ceremony in all Catholic countries, and has been described over and over\n",
      "again. There are some local customs, however, that may be worth noting;\n",
      "for instance, a lady describes a wedding that she saw here in a church,\n",
      "where the groom passed several gold coins into the bride's hands, as an\n",
      "indication that she was to manage their financial affairs. But the\n",
      "chances are more than even that he did not permit her to do anything of\n",
      "the kind. When they knelt at the altar a silken scarf was put around\n",
      "their shoulders and a silver cord around their necks, to indicate their\n",
      "complete union.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A cynical commentator might say,\" observed Fred, \"that the silver cord\n",
      "indicated that the couple was united by financial considerations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's something I've nothing to do with,\" answered Frank, quietly;\n",
      "\"we'll go on with our description. But it is said that marriages in\n",
      "Mexico depend more on social, family, or business matters than upon\n",
      "sentiment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After the church ceremony,\" he continued, \"there is a festival to which\n",
      "intimate friends are invited. Then the pair send cards to all friends\n",
      "and reasonably intimate acquaintances announcing their marriage, and the\n",
      "notice winds up with an equivalent for the 'at home' card of married\n",
      "couples in the United States and England.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: A STUDENT OF \"EL SECRETARIO.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And one thing more,\" added Frank, \"while we are on this subject. A\n",
      "woman who never marries is not stigmatized as an 'old maid,' as is often\n",
      "the case in the Northern States. Nobody ever thinks of suggesting that\n",
      "she has never had an offer of marriage; the remark about her always is\n",
      "that 'she is difficult to suit' even though no man may ever have thought\n",
      "of showing her any attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: MEXICAN WEDDING IN THE COUNTRY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, you understand that in the marriage just described I had the\n",
      "upper classes in mind. Among the common people there is much less\n",
      "ceremony and formality; marriages are generally arranged by the parish\n",
      "priest, who conducts the principal part of the negotiations, and he has\n",
      "also a great deal to say on the subject among the middle, or tradesman,\n",
      "class. There is as much feasting and revelry as the parties can afford,\n",
      "and generally more than is prudent for them. Sometimes matches are made\n",
      "up by the parents of the young couple, without any consultation with\n",
      "them; but as children in this country are obedient to their parents,\n",
      "they are very unlikely to make any opposition to matches thus arranged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank invested a real in a pamphlet called \"El Secretario de los\n",
      "Amantes,\" or, to translate somewhat freely, \"the hand-book of lovers.\"\n",
      "It is probably the most widely circulated book in the Mexican republic,\n",
      "and is as popular among young people as is \"The Complete Letter-Writer,\"\n",
      "among those whose education has not been all they could wish, and who\n",
      "have occasion for epistolary correspondence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earnest attention which was given to this little work as soon as it\n",
      "fell into the hands of the youths led to a suspicion on the part of the\n",
      "Doctor that Frank and Fred meditated a little love-making on their own\n",
      "account, by way of experiment. But so far as we have been informed,\n",
      "nothing of the kind occurred; should any later information on the\n",
      "subject come to hand, it will be duly set forth in the second edition of\n",
      "\"The Boy Travellers in Mexico.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Secretario\" contains a code of cipher writing, forms for using\n",
      "numerals in place of the letters of the alphabet, symbols for each of\n",
      "the twenty-four hours of the day and night or the fractions thereof, and\n",
      "the one-hand alphabet for deaf-mutes. The necessity for this alphabet in\n",
      "love-making, and the practice that comes from it, may probably be the\n",
      "reason why many Spanish-Americans occasionally make signs in\n",
      "conversation, instead of speaking in words. There are chapters of advice\n",
      "to lovers, and there is a full signal code for the use of the fan, the\n",
      "handkerchief, the sombrero, and the glove. Spanish women have long been\n",
      "famed for their skill with the fan, and for the conversations they can\n",
      "conduct with its aid, and it has a very important place in the language\n",
      "of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FLOWERS FOR A LADY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "In most editions of the book there is a separate chapter on the language\n",
      "of flowers and their various meanings accordingly as they are arranged\n",
      "or combined with others. A love-story can be told in the skilful\n",
      "construction of a bouquet--at least enough of it to form the opening\n",
      "chapter. There is also a language of fruits, and Fred suggested that\n",
      "there should be one of tortillas, frijoles, tamals, and other articles\n",
      "of the Mexican cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is a wide range,\" said he, \"for the author of 'El Secretario.'\n",
      "Provide each of the lovers with a thermometer, and then the temperature\n",
      "of a tortilla, as it is tossed into or out of a window, can be made to\n",
      "express a great deal. Forty degrees Fahrenheit might mean, 'My love is\n",
      "cold,' and one hundred and twenty degrees would say, 'I'm sighing like\n",
      "the furnace.' Ninety degrees signifies, 'Look out for the old\n",

      "\n",
      "The youths next considered the subject of the funeral, a ceremony with\n",
      "which the Church has quite as much to do as with weddings. It was Fred's\n",
      "turn to make an investigation, and commit his information to writing,\n",
      "and the following is the result of his efforts:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FUNERAL OF GENERAL DOBLADO, GUANAJUATO.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of the odd things about funerals in this city,\" wrote the youth,\n",
      "\"is that they go by rail to the cemetery. The enterprising manager of\n",
      "the street railways formed his scheme, and then bought up all the\n",
      "hearses, so as to compel the populace to adopt his plan. There was\n",
      "opposition to it at first, but a short trial showed that it was much\n",
      "more economical than the old system. There is a good service of funeral\n",
      "cars, and they are graduated to suit all purses that have any money at\n",
      "all in them. The range of prices is from three to one hundred and twenty\n",
      "dollars; for the lowest sum a single car drawn by a mule is supplied,\n",
      "and for the highest figure one may have a hearse-car, gorgeously draped,\n",
      "plumed, and liveried, drawn by a pair of black horses, and with\n",
      "attendants appropriately liveried and of most solemn countenance. The\n",
      "hearse-car is followed by two, and perhaps three cars, containing the\n",
      "mourners, friends of the deceased, and others, who go to make up the\n",
      "funeral cortége, and these cars are as appropriately draped as the\n",
      "hearse. Ranging between the highest and lowest figures are half a dozen\n",
      "or even more 'outfits,' so that any desires can be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another curious custom is that poor people rent handsome coffins to be\n",
      "used during the funeral ceremony, the body being transferred to a plain\n",
      "unpainted box as soon as it reaches the cemetery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Funeral cards are printed in the newspapers along with the\n",
      "advertisements, and sometimes they have been inadvertently placed among\n",
      "the 'amusements.' They are also posted on the street corners and in\n",
      "other places where they can be seen, and printed cards heavily bordered\n",
      "with black are sent to relatives and friends. There is a fashionable\n",
      "card form for a funeral as much so as for a wedding, and it would be a\n",
      "great social blunder to vary from the conventional style. Friends and\n",
      "relatives must respond to these cards, and any one who has a large\n",
      "circle of acquaintance is obliged to write a good many notes of\n",
      "condolence in the course of a year.\n",

      "\"When we first arrived in the city we were somewhat surprised at the\n",

      "worn not only for relatives but for friends, and there is a prescribed\n",
      "time for which it must be worn in each case. Suppose a school-girl's\n",
      "father or mother dies, her companions put on mourning for fifteen days;\n",
      "if the girl herself dies they go into mourning for a month. The same\n",
      "rule holds throughout society, and there is also a rule that when one\n",
      "visits a house where the family is in mourning, the visitor must be\n",
      "costumed in mourning also. The result is that fashionable people are in\n",
      "mourning for a goodly part of the year, and a mourning suit, or dress,\n",
      "is a necessity for everybody's wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not the custom generally for ladies to attend funerals, but they\n",
      "send cards of condolence and make visits of _pésame_ (regret)\n",
      "immediately after the ceremony. Families in mourning are secluded from\n",
      "society very much as in other civilized countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The old cemeteries which are now in the city limits are closed, and no\n",
      "more burials can be made there. They have a general resemblance to the\n",
      "cemeteries that we described in chapter xxii. of 'The Boy Travellers in\n",
      "South America.' Those who can afford permanent burial for their\n",

      "years to make room for a new tenant. The bones are either buried in one\n",
      "of the new cemeteries or thrown into a pit, where the bones of hundreds\n",
      "who once breathed the air and walked the streets of Mexico are\n",
      "indiscriminately mingled. The new cemeteries are laid out in modern\n",

      "will hire a saddle-horse, and make the excursion on horseback between\n",
      "seven and nine o'clock in the morning, when it is the fashion to appear\n",
      "thus on the Paseo. Doctor Bronson and his young friends followed the\n",

      "away with him. It was naturally supposed that he had been taken to a\n",
      "place of concealment among the foot-hills of the mountains that encircle\n",
      "the valley; but it turned out that his captors drove directly to the\n",
      "city and secreted their victim in the cellar of a house. There he was\n",

      "Fred observed that the Paseo de la Reforma begins at the equestrian\n",
      "statue of Charles IV., very nearly a mile from the Plaza Mayor. It may\n",
      "also be said to begin at the Alameda, a beautiful garden of poplar and\n",

      "shut off by an iron railing, was formerly a canal in the ancient city of\n",
      "Tenochtitlan. This is said to be the exact spot where Alvarado leaped\n",
      "across the canal, and saved himself from the death which overtook so\n",
      "many of his comrades. He commanded the rear-guard, and was one of the\n",
      "few who escaped. Bernal Diaz says the opening was so wide, and the sides\n",
      "so high, that no man in the world could have jumped across, no matter\n",
      "how strong might be his limbs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we are coming to the Noche Triste tree,\" remarked Frank.\n",

      "\"Do you think it is really so?\" Fred asked, turning to Doctor Bronson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The legend is a romantic one,\" the Doctor replied, \"and I would not\n",
      "care to disturb it; but if I read the character of Cortez correctly, he\n",
      "was not the man to sit down and mourn under any circumstances. Quite\n",
      "likely he stopped under the tree on that eventful night of July 1, 1520;\n",
      "but it is more probable that he was planning what to do next instead of\n",
      "wasting his time in vain lamentations. It is time to go now,\" said he,\n",
      "glancing at his watch, \"and we'll have the rest of the story at the foot\n",
      "of the famous tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred folded his manuscript and consigned it to his pocket, and then the\n",
      "trio, accompanied by their guide, proceeded to Popotla by the railway.\n",
      "Taking a car at the west side of the Plaza Mayor, they reached Popotla\n",
      "in little more than half an hour from the time of their departure. They\n",
      "passed through Tacuba, which was anciently an important town, but is now\n",
      "a suburb of the great city, with a population of between two and three\n",
      "thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tree is a species of cedar, called _Ahuehuete_ by the Indians, and\n",
      "_Sabino_ by the Spaniards. Down to a few years ago it was in fine\n",
      "condition, but one night a fire was kindled against it and seriously\n",
      "injured its trunk. Several of its limbs have since died and been\n",
      "removed; and to prevent its utter destruction by relic-hunters, the tree\n",
      "has been surrounded by an iron railing, and is carefully watched by a\n",
      "policeman. Visitors may pick up any twigs lying outside the railing, but\n",
      "they are forbidden to tear anything from the tree, however\n",
      "insignificant.\n",
      "\n",
      "After inspecting the tree, and commenting upon the fact that it was\n",
      "certainly old enough for Cortez to have sat a whole night beneath it and\n",

      "the Conquest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"During the retreat,\" continued Fred, \"the rear-guard of the Spaniards\n",
      "was destroyed; the retreat lasted for six days, and then a battle was\n",
      "fought, on the 7th of July, 1520, on the plains of Otumba. Here Cortez\n",
      "was victorious, but he was not strong enough to attempt to retake the\n",
      "city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He went to Tlascala, where he assembled a large force of natives, and\n",
      "again marched upon the capital. Meantime the Mexicans prepared for\n",
      "defence, and the Emperor having died of small-pox, which the Spaniards\n",
      "introduced, the throne was taken by Guatemozin, the son-in-law of\n",
      "Montezuma. Guatemozin assembled a large army and fortified the\n",

      "[Illustration: THE BATTLE UPON THE CAUSEWAY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cortez had again been 'reinforced' by the Governor of Cuba; the latter\n",
      "had sent two ships to the aid of Narvaez, of whose fate he was ignorant,\n",
      "and when these ships arrived at Vera Cruz they were seized, and the men\n",
      "of the expedition were easily induced to join Cortez.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Approach by land being so well guarded, Cortez decided to attack the\n",

      "side of the mountains, and carried on the shoulders of 8000 Tlascalans\n",
      "to the bank of a small stream flowing into one of the lakes. There the\n",
      "boats were put together, and though the Mexicans made many attacks, they\n",
      "were always defeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each boat carried a piece of artillery and twenty-five Spaniards, and\n",
      "the fleet was sufficient to wipe the war-canoes of the Mexicans out of\n",
      "existence. When all was ready the fleet moved to the attack, and at the\n",

      "the 13th of August, 1521, and that day may be taken as the commencement\n",
      "of the reign of the Spaniards in Mexico. Guatemozin attempted to escape\n",
      "in a boat, but was captured and treated as a prisoner of distinction.\n",
      "The Mexicans again endeavored to drive out their invaders, but were\n",
      "unsuccessful, and Guatemozin was put to death under circumstances of\n",

      "\"He was rewarded by the King with the appointment of Governor and\n",
      "Captain-general of Mexico, and a marquisate with a large revenue. But\n",
      "his success aroused jealousy, as it generally does, and while he was\n",
      "busy with the conquest of the outlying provinces of Mexico his property\n",
      "was seized, and his retainers were imprisoned. He returned to Spain in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He went back to Spain once more, where, with great difficulty, he\n",

      "\"The Church of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe stands on the spot where the\n",

      "Juan Diego, in 1531, ten years after the capture of the city of\n",
      "Tenochtitlan by Cortez. He lived in a mud hut near the base of the hill,\n",
      "and one day, his father being ill, he went to obtain medicine for him,\n",
      "and was stopped by the Virgin, who upbraided him for the slowness of the\n",
      "Mexicans in accepting the religion which the conquerors offered them.\n",
      "She announced that she was to be the patron saint of the Indians, and\n",
      "told him to go and tell the bishop what he had seen and heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He went to the house of Zumarraga, who was then Bishop of Mexico, but\n",
      "was turned away unbelieved and almost unheard. The Virgin appeared to\n",
      "him again, and told him to gather some roses from the top of the rock\n",
      "and carry them in his blanket to the bishop. He did so, and when the\n",
      "blanket was opened the picture of Mary was found to be painted upon it,\n",
      "and surrounded by the imprint of the roses. The bishop was incredulous\n",
      "at first, but when he reflected that the Indian could not paint, and was\n",
      "too poor to employ an artist, he accepted the miracle, and it was soon\n",
      "after adopted by the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not easy to identify the spot, and so the Virgin appeared again\n",
      "and stamped her foot upon the ground. Immediately there burst forth a\n",
      "spring which is said to possess wonderful healing properties, and it has\n",
      "continued to flow ever since. A small chapel was immediately erected,\n",
      "and soon afterwards the foundations of the church were laid. Pope\n",
      "Clement VII. officially proclaimed Our Lady of Guadalupe to be the\n",
      "patron saint of Mexico, and the adoration of the picture spread\n",
      "throughout the whole of America and also to Catholic Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At one time,\" said Frank, in his account of the visit, \"the church of\n",
      "Guadalupe was one of the richest in Mexico, second only to the great\n",
      "cathedral; but the greater part of its treasure was taken by the Liberal\n",
      "Government, and coined into money, at the time of the confiscation of\n",
      "Church property. The golden frame of the picture of the Virgin was\n",
      "carried away, but afterwards returned. The altar railing, of solid\n",
      "silver, was not disturbed. Its value must be very great, as it is\n",
      "massive, and the metal is said to be of the highest standard.\n",

      "[Illustration: STATUETTE OF THE VIRGIN MARY.]\n",

      "\"The original painting is kept in an iron frame above the high altar,\n",
      "and is shown only on rare occasions. By paying a fee to the sacristan we\n",
      "obtained a view of it. The material on which the painting appears is of\n",
      "a very coarse fabric, but the picture is distinct, and its colors seem\n",
      "to be admirably preserved. Copies of the picture are to be seen\n",
      "everywhere. Hardly a house in the country is without one of them, and\n",
      "they are for sale in all shapes and kinds to suit the most economical\n",

      "had taken place as early as the fourth century. The Inquisition was more\n",
      "powerful in Spain than in any other country of Europe; and it never had\n",
      "any hold of consequence outside of Spain, Italy, and France, and the\n",

      "especially exempted the Indians from its operations, and thereby secured\n",
      "its popularity among them, as the public burning of Spanish and other\n",
      "heretics afforded much amusement to the natives, and was a sort of\n",
      "substitute for the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, which the Conquest\n",
      "had abolished. The Mexican Inquisition was under the special charge of\n",
      "the Dominican order, the same as in Spain, and hence was associated with\n",

      "\"There is,\" continued the Doctor, \"a popular misapprehension concerning\n",
      "the _auto-da-fé_, or profession of faith. It is generally believed to be\n",
      "the burning of the condemned, whereas the _auto-da-fé_ was simply the\n",
      "public ceremony that followed the secret trial by the Inquisition. The\n",
      "members of the tribunal, and all others assembled with them, made a\n",
      "public _auto-da-fé_, or profession of their faith in Christianity and\n",
      "the doctrines of the Church. After this was done the list of the\n",
      "condemned was read, together with the punishments accorded to them, and\n",
      "then the victims were handed over to the civil authorities for\n",

      "punishment was that of the civil power only.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The first _auto-da-fé_ in Mexico was in 1574, when 'twenty-one\n",

      "besieged and captured Puebla; then he laid siege to the city of Mexico\n",
      "at the same time that Maximilian was being besieged by another part of\n",
      "the Liberal army at Queretaro. In the following autumn he was a\n",
      "candidate for the Presidency, but was defeated by Juarez; then he laid\n",

      "by way of Vera Cruz. He took passage under an assumed name, and remained\n",
      "in his room on the steamer under pretence of being sea-sick. When the\n",
      "steamer was leaving Tampico he suspected that his identity had been\n",
      "discovered by the officers of a Mexican regiment, which had been taken\n",
      "on board at that port. Discovery and arrest meant execution, and he\n",
      "jumped overboard and endeavored to swim to the shore, which was about\n",
      "ten miles away. The captain thought he was a lunatic, and sent a boat\n",
      "after him; he fought against being rescued, but was taken into the boat\n",
      "and returned to the ship. The purser took charge of him, and Diaz\n",
      "immediately told who he was, and asked for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The purser promised it. The colonel of the regiment suspected that Diaz\n",
      "was on board, and in the hearing of the latter offered $50,000 for\n",
      "information that would lead to his capture. Diaz tells how his heart\n",
      "sank when he heard the offer, and how it beat with satisfaction when\n",
      "the purser replied that he knew nothing about the insurgent leader.\n",
      "\n",

      "the first things he did was to appoint that purser a consul to represent\n",
      "Mexico at a French seaport, and afterwards gave him the consulship at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Oajaca revolution was successful; Lerdo, who was then (1876)\n",
      "President, was driven out of the country, and there was a very disturbed\n",
      "state of affairs for a time. It ended in the election of Diaz as\n",
      "President; he held the office from May, 1877, till November, 1880, when\n",
      "he was succeeded by President Gonzales, the Constitution then in force,\n",
      "and originally proposed by Diaz, forbidding the President to succeed\n",
      "himself. He succeeded Gonzales in 1884 for a second term of four years;\n",
      "in 1887 the Constitution was modified so as to permit the President to\n",
      "serve for a third term, and in consequence of this modification he was\n",
      "again elected in that year. On the 1st of December, 1888, he took the\n",
      "oath of office, in accordance with the Constitutional provisions, and\n",
      "began his third term, which will expire December 1, 1892.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There you have a personal history boiled down. President Diaz is a\n",
      "thorough believer in general education, and in railways, telegraphs, and\n",
      "other modern enterprises; in this belief he has been bitterly opposed by\n",
      "the Reactionary party, which is principally composed of the old\n",
      "aristocracy. In his first term concessions were granted for the\n",
      "construction of railways by American companies, and other concessions\n",
      "have been made since that time. One writer who is not particularly\n",
      "friendly to the President says: 'Under the administration of Diaz\n",
      "manufactures have increased, the resources of the country have been\n",
      "developed, commerce has multiplied, education has been advanced, the\n",
      "revenues have been appropriated to the purposes for which they were\n",
      "designed, travel is safe, bandits have been dispersed, and railroads and\n",
      "telegraphs are extending.' And from all we can learn this is by no means\n",
      "an overstatement of the case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the benefit of his young lady friends at home Fred added to Frank's\n",
      "sketch that President Diaz had been twice married, his present wife\n",
      "being the daughter of Hon. Romero Rubio, Secretary of the Interior. She\n",
      "is said to be a beauty of the brunette type, charming in manners, an\n",
      "accomplished linguist, speaking several languages, of which English is\n",
      "one, and an exquisite judge of feminine apparel. Her dresses are made by\n",
      "Worth, the famous man-milliner of Paris, and therefore she may justly be\n",
      "considered the leader of fashion in the capital of Mexico. Her duties\n",
      "are less onerous than those of the wife of the President of the United\n",
      "States, as there are no receptions similar to those of the White House,\n",
      "and consequently the Mexican capital is free from the social ferment\n",
      "which is constantly going on at Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: HOUSE WITH TILE FRONT.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Bronson added a note to the effect that there was a considerable\n",
      "amount of diplomacy in the marriage of President Diaz with his present\n",
      "wife. Her father was one of the leaders of the Church party, and the\n",
      "marriage strengthened Diaz with the Conservatives by making them less\n",
      "hostile to him and his policy; the party was further conciliated when\n",
      "Señor Rubio became Secretary of the Interior, and other members of the\n",
      "old opposition were provided with places under the Government. But\n",
      "though the hostility of the Church party has been diminished it still\n",
      "exists; its leaders are ready to take advantage of any mistake of the\n",
      "Government, and if they could again obtain control they would speedily\n",
      "overthrow the present Constitution, whose authority they have never\n",
      "acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hostility of the two political parties in Mexico to each other,\"\n",
      "added the Doctor, \"is far greater than that between the two great\n",
      "parties of the United States. The Liberal party in Mexico believes in\n",
      "general education, in the construction of railways, the encouragement of\n",
      "manufacturing and other commercial enterprises, and a complete\n",
      "separation of Church and State. The Clerical party believes in the\n",
      "condition of affairs which existed before 1858, in a union of Church and\n",
      "State, and the control of education by the Church, and it has been a\n",
      "steady and consistent opponent of the railways that connect Mexico with\n",
      "the United States. It looks with alarm upon the present influx of\n",
      "foreigners and the adoption of their ideas by the Mexicans. It is\n",
      "proper to add that this alarm is shared by many adherents of the Liberal\n",

      "had many points of resemblance to that of the United States. Each of the\n",
      "States has the right to manage its own local affairs, but all are bound\n",
      "together for general governmental purposes. The central government\n",
      "consists of legislative, judicial, and executive branches, as in the\n",

      "republic, or one for every 8750 inhabitants; in the United States we\n",
      "have a post-office for every 1200 inhabitants, or seven times as many as\n",
      "Mexico in proportion to the population. The number of pieces of mail\n",
      "matter handled in a year in Mexico is an average of two to each\n",

      "Mexican mails are increasing in importance every year, and will continue\n",
      "to do so as the people become better educated. The extension of the\n",

      "that are not likely to be constructed in the life of the present\n",

      "out the logs is so great that unless high prices were paid for all\n",
      "mahogany the business would be abandoned. The mahogany-cutters search\n",
      "through the forest for trees, and then they build roads, often for many\n",
      "miles, to haul the logs to the banks of the rivers. The logs are usually\n",
      "from ten to sixteen feet long and two to three feet square; the length\n",
      "of the logs will depend upon that of the tree and the number of cuttings\n",

      "one-sixteenth of an inch thick, it would have covered very nearly two\n",
      "acres.\"\n",

      "Fred observed that the logs were square instead of round, and asked why\n",
      "it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are two reasons for it,\" was the reply. \"The first object is to\n",
      "reduce the weight as much as possible without injury to the wood, and\n",
      "hence the workman 'square' the logs roughly as soon as they have been\n",
      "divided into lengths. In the second place, the squaring makes them less\n",
      "liable to roll while upon the rough carts by which they are brought\n",
      "through the forests to the rivers, where they are floated down to the\n",
      "places of shipment. The cutting and hauling are done in the dry season,\n",
      "and the work is timed so that it will be completed when the rainy season\n",
      "sets in. Then the rivers swell and the logs are floated; the system is\n",

      "a \"mysterious city,\" somewhere in the unexplored region of tropical\n",

      "They found that two explorers, Stephens and Morelet, believed in its\n",

      "Stephens learned of it from the _cura_ of Quiche, a native town of\n",
      "Guatemala, who claimed to have looked upon the city from the wall of\n",
      "rock surrounding the valley where it stands. He had heard of it many\n",
      "years before at the village of Chajul. He was then young, and had\n",

      "his elevated stand-point looked down upon the plain and the white walls\n",
      "and towers of the city glistening in the sun. It covered a large area,\n",
      "and its people were advanced in the arts and capable of making a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Writers on the subject are not very encouraging,\" said Frank, \"as they\n",

      "who comes within their boundaries. Not even the Spanish _padres_ are\n",
      "permitted to enter, and they are usually able to go where no other white\n",

      "Probably Frank's belief was largely influenced by the circumstance that\n",

      "\"There is a region lying between Chiapas, Tabasco, Yucatan, and the\n",
      "Republic of Guatemala, and comprising a considerable portion of each of\n",
      "those States, which, if not entirely blank, is only conjecturally filled\n",
      "up with mountains, lakes, and rivers. It is almost as unknown as the\n",

      "Having once reached the city they were not harmed; but when they\n",
      "attempted to escape they were seized, and one of them was sacrificed on\n",
      "the altar of the Sun, after the manner of the Aztec sacrifices already\n",
      "described. The other made his escape, but was so badly wounded that he\n",
      "died in the forest. Don Pedro and a few Indians who accompanied the\n",
      "young gentlemen managed to get away with their lives, but only by\n",
      "running great risks. The account he gives of their adventures is not\n",
      "very clear, and it has not secured a prominent place in the history of\n",
      "scientific explorations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years ago an enterprising American naturalist, Mr. F. A. Ober, was\n",
      "on the borders of this unexplored region, and was greatly tempted to\n",
      "venture alone in search of the mysterious city, and particularly to\n",
      "learn about the fauna and flora that abound in its vicinity. It would\n",
      "have been madness for him to have undertaken the journey, and he wisely\n",
      "refrained from doing so; he is still of opinion that the examination of\n",
      "this unknown and unconquered region offers a fine field for the\n",
      "naturalist, and for societies engaged in promoting scientific\n",

      "Doctor Bronson suggested that in the mean while they could amuse\n",
      "themselves by reading \"The Phantom City,\" a romance based upon the\n",

      "The steamer made a brief halt at Carmen, an insignificant town on an\n",
      "island on the coast, and then proceeded to Campeachy, where she anchored\n",
      "about five miles from shore. There was quite a ground-swell on the sea,\n",
      "which would have made a journey to the shore somewhat uncomfortable,\n",
      "with the possibility, in case the wind increased, of being detained\n",
      "there until the next steamer happened along. So our friends concluded to\n",
      "acquaint themselves with Campeachy by looking at it from the deck of\n",

      "the youths were impatient to be on their way.\n",

      "of the mountain chain which he claims to have ascended. They learned\n",
      "that Campeachy was once of more importance than it is to-day; it has a\n",

      "artificial. These caves were made by the Indians long ago; most of them\n",
      "have been explored in search of treasure, of which very little was\n",
      "obtained. Numerous skulls and skeletons were found there, and it is\n",
      "evident that the caves were used as burial-places, and are much like the\n",
      "catacombs of Oriental countries. A few of them have been utilized as\n",
      "cellars by the inhabitants, but only a few; the Indians of to-day have a\n",

      "A lighter came alongside with some cargo for the steamer, and Frank made\n",
      "a note of what it brought. There were hides of cattle, deer-skins, sugar\n",
      "in bags made of the _pita_ plant, bales of that textile product,\n",
      "beeswax, and a considerable quantity of Campeachy cigars. The tobacco\n",

      "Frank learned that logwood is an important article of trade on this part\n",
      "of the coast, but it is mostly shipped on sailing-vessels, on account of\n",
      "the lower charge for freight. Carmen has a considerable commerce in\n",
      "logwood, which grows so extensively that there is no immediate danger of\n",
      "the exhaustion of the supply, especially as its cultivation has extended\n",
      "to other countries by planting the seed or transplanting the young\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Logwood is used for dyeing purposes,\" wrote Frank, after he had\n",
      "informed himself concerning it, \"and also in medicine. There is a belief\n",
      "that it is used by wine-makers in coloring claret quite as much as for\n",
      "dyeing cloth or leather. The tree is usually about twenty-five feet high\n",
      "and fifteen inches in diameter. Only the 'heart' of the trunk contains\n",
      "the dyeing substance, and this is the part exported, the outer sap-wood\n",
      "being cut off in the forest as soon as the tree is felled. The\n",
      "logwood-cutters have a hard life, and their business is less profitable\n",

      "A passenger who came on board the steamer at Campeachy had as part of\n",
      "his baggage a cage containing a bird of remarkable plumage. It presented\n",
      "a variety of colors--green, golden, red, and white--and its tail\n",
      "feathers were so long that they seemed out of all proportion to the size\n",

      "and asked what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a _quezal_, or _quetzal_,\" was the reply, \"which was at one time\n",
      "the sacred and imperial bird of Mexico. The one you see here is not a\n",
      "fine specimen. Sometimes you find these birds with the tail feathers\n",
      "four feet long; and in ancient times none but the emperors were\n",
      "permitted to wear them. Perhaps you saw the feather cloak of Montezuma\n",
      "in the museum at the capital? Well, the feathers that adorn that cloak\n",
      "came from the quezal, and the bird is so rare that it takes a long time\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: DIFFICULTIES OF TRAVEL IN CAMPEACHY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The quezal is still regarded with much respect by the Indians of this\n",
      "part of the country and of Central America, but less so than in the days\n",
      "of the Montezumas. As it darts through the forest its feathers flash\n",
      "like a moving rainbow, and remind us of the accounts that Eastern\n",
      "travellers have given of the bird-of-paradise. It is rarely taken alive,\n",
      "and is so shy that the hunter can only approach it with difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This region abounds in birds,\" continued his informant, \"and also with\n",
      "less pleasing things to meet--snakes. Some of the serpents are large and\n",
      "others are venomous. It is a fortunate thing for travellers in the\n",
      "forest that the snake seeks safety in flight when he can do so, and does\n",
      "not voluntarily attack man. Birds and small animals are his prey, and he\n",
      "takes them after the same fashion as the serpents of the rest of the\n",
      "world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred asked what was the most dangerous of the serpents of this tropical\n",
      "region.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The worst I know of,\" was the reply, \"is the _vivora de sangre_, which\n",
      "causes the blood of man or beast to sweat through the pores of the body\n",
      "until the veins are exhausted and the victim dies in a state of utter\n",
      "weakness. It is literally a case of bleeding to death, though not in the\n",
      "ordinary way of opening the veins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he told of another serpent called the _mica_, or whipping-snake,\n",
      "which when irritated flattens its head upon the ground and seems to\n",
      "fasten it there. Then it lashes on either side with its tail like a\n",
      "whip, and it strikes a blow of wonderful force when its size is\n",
      "considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed an extended conversation upon the natural history of\n",
      "Campeachy and the regions bordering it, but the youths did not take\n",
      "further notes, and so we are unable to repeat what was said. Some of the\n",
      "stories of the traveller were impressed on the mind of Frank more on\n",
      "account of their improbability than for any other peculiarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told about serpents thirty feet long that suspended themselves from\n",
      "trees which overhung path-ways, and swooped down upon cattle, sheep, and\n",
      "other animals that came within their reach. Frank asked if human beings\n",
      "were exempt from their attacks, and the stranger replied that those who\n",
      "ate plenty of _chili colorado_ with their food were not disturbed, or at\n",
      "any rate the snake would not swallow them, as he wasn't fond of red\n",
      "pepper. He might kill them before finding out the fact, but as soon as\n",
      "he had done so he would respectfully turn aside and seek other game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed a story about another variety of snake that kills a bird\n",
      "on its nest and then proceeds to coil affectionately about the eggs and\n",
      "hatch them out. When the young birds appear he cares for them tenderly,\n",
      "bringing them food in the daytime, and at night nestling over them to\n",
      "protect their unfeathered bodies from the cold and dampness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I suppose,\" said Frank, \"that when he has reared them to a suitable\n",
      "size he proceeds to eat them up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As to that the stranger could give no information, and accordingly the\n",

      "From Campeachy the steamer held her course to Progreso, the principal\n",

      "of commerce. Not that the harbor amounts to much, as the shallow coast\n",
      "prevents vessels of more than a few feet draught from coming anywhere\n",
      "near it. The passengers were landed in a large row-boat that danced\n",
      "very uneasily upon the waves and disturbed the digestion of some who\n",

      "half-hour in which to inspect the town of Progreso; they inspected it\n",

      "The carriages in waiting were of various kinds. That which first caught\n",
      "the eyes of the youths was a _calesa_, a sort of chaise carrying two\n",
      "persons, the driver being seated on the horse; the shafts were of\n",
      "unusual length, and the weight was so placed that fully one-third of it\n",
      "rested on the animal, in addition to that of the driver. The wood-work\n",
      "was bright with paint and gilding, and over the frame was drawn a cover\n",
      "of white linen to ward off rain and dust together with the heat of the\n",
      "sun, which is by no means light in Yucatan. Fred suggested that it was a\n",
      "wise provision of nature to seat the driver on the horse, as he could\n",
      "not conveniently go to sleep there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A somewhat rickety carriage to hold four persons was secured, and in\n",
      "this conveyance the travellers proceeded to the only hotel of which\n",
      "Merida can boast. Until recently the place had no hotel whatever, and\n",
      "strangers were obliged to hunt lodgings for themselves or apply to their\n",
      "consular representative or a foreign merchant. Even as it is, a letter\n",
      "of introduction to a resident is a very useful document. Few travellers\n",
      "go to Merida, and the universal testimony of those who have been there\n",
      "is that the residents are hospitable. The same may be said generally of\n",
      "the inhabitants of the towns, villages, and haciendas throughout\n",
      "Yucatan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets of Merida are broader than those of many other Mexican\n",

      "exact, but it is quite likely that the defeated army was vastly superior\n",

      "of fire-arms, as they had in the conquest of Mexico, and we have seen in\n",
      "previous pages what a great advantage it was. The Indians had only\n",
      "spears, swords, and bows and arrows, and their bodily defences were\n",
      "tunics of wadded cotton. These tunics were efficient against their own\n",
      "kind of weapons, but of little use to repel a musket-ball. The cannon of\n",
      "the Spaniards created terrible havoc among them, and one chronicler says\n",

      "Where is now the Plaza Mayor was a mound of stone and earth at the time\n",

      "sacrifices were made; but the natives were not as much addicted to them\n",
      "as were the people of Mexico. This very circumstance had much to do with\n",
      "the success of Cortez in his conquest. The Aztecs sought to take their\n",
      "enemies alive in order to sacrifice them on their altars; and it is said\n",
      "that Cortez himself was in their hands on two occasions. They might\n",

      "\"For the convenience of the Indians who could not read or write Spanish,\n",
      "or anything else, in fact, the streets were named after birds and\n",

      "of the creature after which the street was called. The Street of the Ox\n",
      "had the figure of an ox in stone or plaster, or painted on the wall; the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Half the population of the city seemed to have gathered there--Indians,\n",
      "mestizos, Spaniards, foreigners, and dogs; and there was a hum of voices\n",
      "which never ceased for an instant. The manners of the natives are more\n",
      "pleasing than those of the people in the markets of Mexico. They chat\n",
      "good-naturedly and with many a smile, as though they enjoyed coming to\n",
      "the market without regard to whether they sell anything or not. A great\n",
      "deal of bargaining is necessary in making purchases, for the Indian has\n",
      "no notion of the value of time; and for the matter of that, the tropical\n",
      "resident, whatever his nationality, is rarely in a hurry. We passed many\n",
      "picturesque groups, fruit-sellers with their wares in broad baskets,\n",
      "their heads wrapped in rebozos either white or colored, and their eyes\n",
      "shining like little globes of polished anthracite set in their brown\n",

      "A _medio_ would buy all the oranges, bananas, or mangoes that one would\n",
      "care for. Frank and I invested two medios (twelve cents) in oranges, and\n",
      "distributed them to a lot of boys that were strolling through the place.\n",
      "They took the fruit with an air of gratitude combined with dignity, and\n",

      "keep off the heat of the sun. These shelters were made by sticking up\n",
      "poles so as to hold a piece of matting or common cloth in a horizontal\n",
      "position. Under each of these impromptu tents a vender was seated,\n",
      "generally a woman or a girl, and the articles for sale were spread on\n",

      "trod upon the wares, which were certainly endangered by careless feet.\n",
      "Mules and donkeys with large panniers on each side brought loads of\n",
      "things to be disposed of, but the greater part of the burdens were borne\n",
      "on the backs of men. Occasionally a man on horseback appeared in the\n",
      "market, and once in a while a policeman showed himself, though his\n",

      "attractive restaurants we could find, and squatted on the ground close\n",
      "to the one individual who was proprietor, _chef_, head-waiter, waiter,\n",
      "and everybody else. Our breakfast was a stew of frijoles, chile con\n",
      "carne, and tortillas. It was served to us in _jicaras_, or half-shells\n",
      "of some kind of tree-fruit whose name we did not learn. No spoons or\n",
      "forks were supplied. We used the tortillas for spoons, and afterwards\n",
      "devoured them in true Mexican style. As Sam Weller said of veal-pie, a\n",
      "medio breakfast in a Yucateo restaurant is 'werry fillin'' at the price.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'That,' said he, 'is yucca, and it belongs to the same family as the\n",

      "people for gambling, and hence our misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We bought a medio's worth of the article and tasted it. The flavor was\n",
      "something like that of a sweet turnip, and not at all disagreeable. I\n",
      "can readily understand that one might become fond of it, and our friend\n",
      "said that it was quite nutritious. The root is eaten by the natives, the\n",
      "fibres furnish a textile fabric like henequin, and soap is made from the\n",
      "stalk and leaves. Recently an enterprising American has manufactured a\n",
      "preparation for the hair from the yucca plant, and it is said to possess\n",

      "\"Our guide took us into a large hall, which is open to the public, or\n",
      "rather to anybody who can force his way through the dense crowd at the\n",
      "door. All classes seemed to have assembled there; rich and poor were\n",
      "seated at the same tables, and their object seemed to be amusement\n",
      "rather than gain. The stakes were very small, ordinarily a medio, and in\n",
      "a few instances _dos reales_. The room was hot as an oven, brilliantly\n",
      "lighted, every foot of standing and sitting room was occupied, and white\n",
      "people of all grades in life, gentlemen as well as ladies, negroes,\n",
      "Indians, and mestizos crowded together at the tables, which were in two\n",
      "rows the whole length of the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The amusement is licensed by the Government, which sells sheets of\n",
      "paper for a real each on which the game is played. It is done by a\n",
      "combination of numbers all the way from one to ninety. These numbers are\n",
      "arranged on the paper or cards in different combinations, no two cards\n",
      "being alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each player buys a card and places it in front of him on the table.\n",
      "Then a hat or a basket is passed around, and each one puts in his medio\n",
      "or whatever else the stake may be. When the money has all been collected\n",
      "and the amount of the stake announced, the game begins. In addition to\n",
      "his card each player has a pile of grains of corn in front of him, and a\n",
      "stick with which to rap on the table when the time to do so arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The object is to get a row of five numbers on the cards from the\n",

      "containing wooden or ivory balls, on which the numbers from one to\n",
      "ninety are painted. When the game is to begin, this man draws a ball\n",
      "from the bag and announces the number upon it, and the player who finds\n",
      "that number on his card places a grain of corn over the figures. One\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Everybody is intently watching his card, and there is a crowd of\n",
      "spectators looking over the shoulders of the players. Men, women,\n",
      "children--white, black, yellow, and all other colors possible to\n",
      "humanity--are there; and so are all the dresses of Yucatan, from the\n",
      "uniform of the high official and the satin or silk of the grand dame of\n",
      "society down to the cotton garb of the Indian, and quite likely his bare\n",

      "the man on the platform calls the drawn numbers again, and if the\n",
      "announcement of the row is correct the winner takes the purse. As the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mistakes occur sometimes, and then there is a tumult, in which knives\n",

      "\"The market we have described,\" wrote Fred, \"is for the sale of articles\n",
      "of food only. There is another market where pottery, cotton fabrics, and\n",
      "other miscellaneous wares are sold, and still another which is entirely\n",
      "given up to the makers and venders of hats and hammocks. Hammock-making\n",
      "is a great industry in Yucatan, and thousands of these articles are sent\n",
      "to New York, London, and other foreign ports. A curious circumstance\n",
      "about this industry is that the best hammocks are those for home\n",
      "consumption; the foreign markets are unwilling to pay the prices of the\n",
      "fine qualities, and consequently none are sent away except upon special\n",
      "orders. When you next buy a Yucatan hammock in New York you may make up\n",
      "your mind that it is one in which only a very poor man here would sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: VIEW ON A BACK STREET.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hammocks are in use for sleeping purposes all through this country, and\n",
      "the natives prefer them to beds. Our personal experience is that a\n",
      "hammock is a very good thing to lounge in, or even to take a nap, but\n",
      "for an all-night sleep it doesn't give the rest and refreshment to the\n",
      "tired body that we find in a bed. But habit has a great deal to do with\n",
      "this, as with many other things of life; a Japanese pillow is torture to\n",
      "a European quite as much as the European one is to a Japanese.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The advantages claimed for a hammock are that the sleeper is protected\n",
      "from many insects that would trouble him in a bed, and the opportunity\n",
      "for the air to circulate, which is a very desirable matter in a hot\n",
      "country. Both these arguments are well founded, and so is the further\n",
      "one that the hammock-sleeper can carry his bed with him, as it weighs\n",
      "only a few ounces and can be rolled into a small parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We asked the prices and were staggered at the figures. In New York we\n",
      "think $2 a good price, and the majority of the hammocks sold there bring\n",
      "$1 or $1.50 each. The cheapest they showed us was $7, and they had them\n",
      "all the way up to $15, $18, $20, $25, and even $30. The dealer said that\n",
      "if these were not fine enough for our purpose we might have them made to\n",
      "order, and he could give us something superb for $50. We bought some of\n",
      "the cheapest kind, and they were far better than anything we ever saw at\n",
      "home. The best qualities are made of very fine fibre, and if care is\n",
      "taken with them they last for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While walking along the streets near the market we met some ladies to\n",
      "whom we had been introduced. They recognized and saluted us; they were\n",
      "on the opposite sidewalk, and at first we thought they were beckoning\n",
      "for us to cross over to their side. Then we remembered what we had been\n",
      "told about the Yucateo form of salutation, and replied by raising our\n",
      "hats and bowing. This is what they did:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each lady raised her hand until it was on a level with her eyes, and\n",
      "then she 'wiggled' her fingers back and forth in a way that is\n",
      "impossible to describe in words. It is very much what one would do in\n",
      "our country if she wished to speak to you, and we can readily believe\n",
      "what we have been told, that this form of salutation is a great puzzle\n",
      "to the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day an Englishman, who was thus saluted, went up to his fair\n",
      "recognizer, a lady to whom he had been presented at a party on the\n",
      "previous evening, and stood waiting for her to begin the conversation.\n",
      "She was accompanied by another lady, neither of whom could speak\n",
      "English, while the Englishman did not know a word of any language but\n",
      "his own. The situation was awkward, and after both had pronounced\n",
      "several phrases that the other side could not comprehend, the Englishman\n",
      "bowed and proceeded to walk away. The lady repeated the Merida\n",
      "salutation, and this puzzled the stranger more than ever, as he supposed\n",
      "she wished him to follow. He gallantly complied, and walked demurely\n",
      "along till he happened to meet the gentleman who had introduced him.\n",
      "Explanations followed, and all parties concerned had a good laugh over\n",
      "the occurrence. It is probable that the Englishman's laugh was less\n",
      "hearty than that of the others, as he could not fail to be somewhat\n",
      "mortified at his awkward misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the fashionable hours for strolling on the paseo everybody is there,\n",
      "and no matter how often you meet any one whom you know you are expected\n",
      "to salute. This keeps everybody on the alert, as the turns of the paseo\n",
      "are likely to bring the same individuals face to face every few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE IN A BALL-ROOM.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was our good-fortune to be in Merida in the season of dancing, and\n",
      "we were invited to go to a ball, in fact to several balls. We went first\n",
      "to an aristocratic one, which was given in the Casino, a large,\n",
      "two-storied building, with balconies or verandas all around, and\n",
      "brilliantly lighted. It is built around a court-yard planted with\n",
      "tropical trees and flowers in great profusion, and is a very attractive\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ball-room occupied three sides of the upper story of the building,\n",
      "while the fourth contained the dressing and supper rooms. The orchestra\n",
      "was in the corridor just outside the dancing-hall, and while everybody\n",
      "could hear the music, very few could see the musicians. We got there\n",
      "before the dance began and while the ladies were coming out of the\n",
      "dressing-rooms and taking seats at the side of the ball-room, very much\n",
      "as they are seated in other countries. We observed that the gentlemen\n",
      "held the ladies by the hand as they escorted them to their seats, and\n",
      "not by giving them their arms as we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a real beauty show when the ladies were ranged along the wall,\n",
      "and they seemed to know it just as well as did their admirers, who\n",
      "congregated at one end of the hall and in the corridors, and smoked\n",
      "cigarettes. The gentlemen chatted with each other with more or less\n",
      "animation, but watched the line of señoritas, whose eyes sparkled like\n",
      "diamonds and were a sharp contrast to their pearly white teeth. Under\n",
      "the light the señoritas' complexions were as glowing as that of a young\n",
      "English girl; of course, we cannot say how much of it is due to nature,\n",
      "and how much to cosmetics. They all had splendid heads of coal-black\n",
      "hair, arranged in the tasteful way for which Spanish ladies are famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The music struck up for a waltz, and then each gentleman advanced\n",
      "towards the lady of his choice, and whirled her away for the round of\n",
      "the hall. The theory of these balls is that everybody knows everybody\n",
      "else, and the gentlemen did not ask the ladies whether they wanted to\n",
      "dance or not. Of course, it is to be presumed that they were there with\n",
      "that object in view, but we thought it would be more graceful if they\n",
      "had been consulted before being lifted from their seats and set in\n",
      "motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had wondered how it was possible for people to dance in this hot\n",
      "atmosphere, but when we heard how slowly the music played, and saw that\n",
      "the waltz was only a slow gliding and sliding over the floor, as though\n",
      "the waltzers were not more than half awake, we wondered no longer. It is\n",
      "nothing like the exciting whirl of a waltz in northern countries; and\n",
      "the same may be said of the other dances of this very select assemblage.\n",
      "We remained half an hour or so, and then went to the mestizo ball, where\n",
      "it was a good deal more animated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The mestizo girls wore the white dresses already described; some of\n",
      "them had only a few ribbons or flowers for ornaments, while others were\n",
      "loaded down with bracelets, rings, and other ornaments, in which\n",
      "diamonds had a more or less prominent part. A gentleman who was with us\n",
      "said many of the diamonds were hired for the occasion, and he had no\n",
      "doubt that a good share of them were paste. The men were the most\n",
      "comical sights you can imagine, as they all wore their hats, and the\n",
      "most of them had their shirts waving outside, after the custom of the\n",
      "country. Some of them had coats and jackets. A man thus clad was looked\n",
      "upon as an aristocrat; but to be so considered he was obliged to suffer\n",
      "some inconvenience, as the outer garment is a serious burden in the\n",
      "heavy tropical atmosphere, made doubly oppressive by the heat of the\n",
      "room. Two or three men carried their jackets on their arms, and some\n",
      "flung them into a corner at the risk of never finding them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The musicians were native Indians, who played with perfect time and\n",
      "melody, as though they had graduated from the schools of the most\n",
      "accomplished masters of Europe. All these people are natural musicians;\n",
      "a very little instruction suffices for them, and with careful training\n",
      "they ought to be able to astonish the world. The men and women dance to\n",
      "perfection; we did not see a false step taken during the time we looked\n",
      "on at the ball, and yet it is not likely that any of the dancers ever\n",
      "had the advantage of a professional instructor. The members of the\n",
      "orchestra at the mestizo ball were dressed in the shirt and drawers\n",
      "already mentioned, and, like the dancing men of the party, retained\n",
      "their hats all the time they played.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dances were more interesting than those of the fashionable ball,\n",
      "inasmuch as the latter were European in character, while those of the\n",
      "mestizos had a peculiarity of their own. One was called the zopilote, or\n",
      "buzzard dance; a man and a woman each carrying a handkerchief which they\n",
      "twirled above their heads, and in all sorts of directions whirled and\n",
      "twisted themselves along the floor, all the while keeping perfect time\n",
      "to the music of the performers. It reminded us very much of one of the\n",
      "national dances of the Russians, which is often given by the ballet\n",
      "troupes of the imperial theatres of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and may\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'The first thing these Indians did was to spread a banner in the centre\n",
      "of the room, on which was painted a figure of the sun, with two people\n",
      "kneeling in adoration of it. The chief of this band of about twenty\n",
      "Indians then suspended from his neck a bright-colored representation of\n",
      "the sun stamped on tin. At the foot of the banner-staff crouched an old\n",
      "man, with a drum made by stretching the skin of a calf or goat over one\n",
      "end of a hollow log; at the side of the drum hung the shell of a\n",
      "land-tortoise, and the old man beat the drum and rattled the shell in\n",
      "unison. The article with which he beat the drum attracted my attention,\n",
      "and I examined it and found it to be the gilded horn of a deer. This\n",
      "hollow drum, with turtle-shell and deer's antler, fully confirms the\n",
      "statement that the music is aboriginal; for one of the old chroniclers,\n",
      "in an account of a terrible battle with the Indians of Campeachy,\n",
      "writing not long after the event, says that they made a most horrible\n",
      "and deafening noise with these instruments: \"They had flutes and large\n",
      "sea-shells for trumpets, and turtle-shells, which they struck with\n",
      "deer's horns.\"\n",

      "[Illustration: PREPARING FOR THE BALL.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'After the banner was spread, the band ran around it in a crouching\n",
      "attitude; in one hand each held a rattle, and in the other a fan of\n",
      "turkey feathers, with a handle formed by the foot and claw of the bird.\n",
      "Each one wore a wire mask, with a handkerchief over his head, and a\n",
      "mantle embroidered with figures of animals, and hung with small\n",
      "sea-shells. The costume was that of the mestizo women--a skirt from the\n",
      "waist to the ankles, with their peculiar dress over it--just such an one\n",
      "as was worn by their ancestors centuries ago, and by the ancient\n",
      "Egyptians. On their feet they wore sandals, tied on with hempen rope.\n",
      "The chief was distinguished by a high crown of peacock feathers. He\n",
      "chanted something in the Maya language, and they replied, and then the\n",
      "music struck up a weird strain and they danced furiously, assuming\n",
      "ludicrous postures, yet all having seeming significance, shaking their\n",
      "rattles and fans to right and left, and all keeping perfect time. After\n",
      "nearly half an hour of dancing they stopped at a signal from the chief,\n",

      "over the roads with commendable rapidity, when all things are\n",
      "considered. There is a great deal of swing to the vehicle, and it\n",
      "overturns occasionally, though not often. The roads of Yucatan are not\n",
      "at all good; one man told us they were made by Cortez three and a half\n",

      "Their entertainer, Mr. Honradez, suggested that Doctor Bronson and\n",
      "himself would ride in one carriage, while the two youths occupied the\n",

      "travellers carried a small hand-bag, and these articles, added to some\n",

      "bent beneath their burdens, and many of them had travelled all night in\n",
      "order to reach the city in the morning. The most conspicuous of these\n",
      "porters were the sellers of _ramon_, the branches of a tree that serve\n",
      "as food for horses and mules, which eat the leaves and twigs of ramon as\n",

      "\"Mr. Honradez made things interesting,\" said Fred, \"by getting up a race\n",
      "between our two carriages. He promised two reals to the driver who would\n",
      "get first to a village which he named, and the fellows went at it in\n",
      "earnest. They stood up on the shafts of their vehicles and yelled at\n",
      "their mules; at the same time they were not sparing of their whips, and\n",
      "the result was that the poor beasts went at a furious gallop for a mile\n",

      "use. The old process of making fibre by hand is altogether discarded as\n",
      "unprofitable, and the stripping of the leaves of the henequin is\n",

      "already that the plants are in condition for cutting when they are five\n",
      "years old, and will yield leaves annually for fifteen or twenty years. A\n",
      "good planter will so arrange it that new plants are constantly coming to\n",

      "\"Not literally all,\" said the gentleman, \"but for practical purposes the\n",

      "United States, where it is used for cordage, bagging, and many other\n",
      "things of the same sort, and most of the rest to Europe. There are two\n",
      "or three small factories here in Yucatan for making coarse cloth, ropes,\n",

      "woven. These factories purchase their fibre from the haciendas, but\n",
      "their consumption is small. The Indians use a great deal of fibre in\n",
      "making articles for their personal needs, but they generally scrape it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll show you one in the morning,\" was the reply. Then there was\n",
      "an exchange of wishes all around for a pleasant slumber, and in a little\n",
      "while everybody was in bed, or rather in hammock. Our friends had\n",
      "brought their hammocks as part of their baggage, and when they were\n",
      "ready to retire they found those useful articles stretched in the\n",
      "corridor of the principal dwelling of the hacienda, in a place that\n",
      "afforded ample ventilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was owing to the expected cenoté or the unrestful character\n",
      "of a night's novitiate in a hammock we are unable to say, but the youths\n",
      "were up somewhat earlier than usual and eager to begin the day. Doctor\n",
      "Bronson was not far behind them, and they did not have to wait long for\n",
      "their host. When he appeared he was followed by a mozo carrying an\n",
      "armful of towels, and after a hearty greeting led the way to a small\n",
      "house at a little distance from the stables of the hacienda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred suggested to his cousin, while their host was in conversation with\n",
      "Doctor Bronson, that the cenoté was probably some kind of game, and they\n",
      "would quite likely have it for breakfast. \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"they keep\n",
      "it alive and kill it when wanted, and this house may be the place where\n",
      "it is shut up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's something to wear,\" replied Frank, \"and the house is the\n",
      "store-room. Possibly, though, it's some kind of vegetable like celery or\n",
      "onions. Anyway, we'll find out soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were speedily enlightened on the subject. On reaching the house in\n",
      "question, Mr. Honradez explained that it was the entrance to a private\n",
      "cenoté of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are already aware,\" said he, \"that there are no rivers in Yucatan,\n",
      "and have learned from experience that we have plenty of water,\n",
      "notwithstanding the absence of streams. Beneath the calcareous formation\n",
      "on which the whole of the peninsula stands there are streams and lakes\n",
      "of water, which are reached through natural or artificial openings in\n",
      "the surface rock. These openings, whether natural or artificial, are\n",
      "called cenotés, and some of them are of great depth. Sometimes they are\n",
      "mere pits or wells, and, on the other hand, there are cenotés which form\n",
      "large grottos with lakes of considerable area. The water is clear and\n",
      "cool and entirely wholesome. We use the cenotés for obtaining our supply\n",
      "of water and also for bathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is our bathing-house,\" he continued, \"and I've brought you here\n",
      "for your morning bath. You will find bathing-trousers in the rooms, and\n",
      "can undress and come down as soon as you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed them the way into their dressing-rooms, and then disappeared\n",
      "into a room of his own. When the youths reappeared, in appropriate\n",
      "costume, their host called to them from somewhere down in the interior\n",
      "of the earth, and they proceeded in the direction of the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: AN UNDERGROUND WALK.]\n",
      "\n",
      "By a sloping and slippery stair-way cut in the rock they descended some\n",
      "thirty-five or forty feet till they reached a pool of clear water over\n",
      "which the rock rounded in a high dome nearly to the surface. A hole two\n",
      "or three feet in diameter and covered with an iron grating opened in the\n",
      "centre of the dome, and gave light enough to show the interior of the\n",
      "place very fairly. Many stalactites hung from the roof, and stalagmites\n",
      "stood up wherever they could find standing room. From the grotto where\n",
      "our friends found themselves little nooks and small grottos opened, so\n",
      "that the spot was by no means unattractive. Numerous lizards clung to\n",
      "the rock or swam in the water; and these crawling and slimy things took\n",
      "away many of the merits the bathing-place might have possessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FORMATION OF STALACTITES.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lizards do no harm,\" said Mr. Honradez, \"but they are not pleasant\n",
      "to look at, and we would gladly drive them out if we could. There is a\n",
      "curious bird called the 'toh' which lives in the cenotés; it has a soft\n",
      "plumage, and sports a long tail of only two feathers, which have nothing\n",
      "on their stems until the very tip is reached. If you look sharp you may\n",
      "possibly see an eyeless fish similar to the fishes which are found in\n",
      "the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths looked in every direction, and though Frank thought he saw\n",
      "one of these strange members of the finny tribe he was unable to capture\n",
      "it. Frank asked if the cenotés communicated with each other or were\n",
      "separately supplied from the rains sinking into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot say that all of them are connected,\" was the reply; \"but it\n",
      "is certain that some of them are. Many contain streams with perceptible\n",
      "currents, and it has been observed that at times the cenotés are full of\n",
      "alligators, while at others none can be found there. As the alligator\n",
      "cannot pierce its way through solid rock, there must be channels which\n",
      "connect with large bodies of water where the alligators live.\"\n",

      "At the suggestion of alligators Frank and Fred intimated that they did\n",

      "whence it was taken by the servants from the kitchen, or allowed to flow\n",

      "\"In nearly every village throughout Yucatan,\" said Mr. Honradez, \"you\n",
      "will find a well of this sort in the public square; it is called a\n",
      "_noria_, and the usual mode of drawing water is by an endless rope\n",
      "passing over a wheel and carrying small buckets. These bring up the\n",
      "water from below, and as they turn over the wheel they pour their\n",
      "contents into a trough. The system is almost an exact copy of that in\n",
      "use in Egypt centuries before Yucatan was heard of. The rude machine is\n",
      "propelled by a mule walking in a circle and driven by a boy. The mule is\n",
      "invariably an old one, fit for no other work, and sometimes a horse or\n",
      "ox, likewise old and poor, is found in its place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose the village pays for the mule and the driver,\" one of the\n",
      "youths remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was the reply; \"and the payment is by direct taxation. Every\n",
      "person who takes a jar of water is expected to leave a handful of corn\n",
      "in payment. This corn goes for the support of the boy and the animal,\n",
      "and to judge by the condition of the beast, the lion's share of the tax\n",
      "is taken by the boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation about the curious wells of Yucatan came to an end with\n",
      "several stories concerning them. One was that in the town of Tabi there\n",
      "is a large cenoté which shows down in the depths of the water when the\n",
      "sun is at the meridian the perfect figure of a palm-tree, trunk, leaves,\n",
      "and all being fully delineated. In another town there is a cenoté where,\n",
      "according to the early chroniclers, any one dies instantly who enters\n",
      "the water without holding his breath. It is needless to say that bathing\n",
      "there is not at all popular. Other subterranean pools contain poisonous\n",
      "lizards which cause violent and even fatal headaches by merely biting\n",
      "the shadow of any person who passes them. Another lizard, when wounded,\n",
      "is said to throw its tail at its assailant; it detaches and throws it a\n",
      "distance of several yards, and if it strikes the flesh will cause death.\n",
      "Many of the cenotés are reputed to be the haunts of demons and fairies,\n",
      "the bad spirits being much more numerous than the good ones.\n",

      "In the cool hours of the afternoon our friends started on their return\n",
      "to Merida, and late in the evening drew up in front of the hotel. Their\n",
      "host urged them to remain a week or two at the hacienda; with the\n",
      "politeness customary to the country, he told them that the place and\n",
      "everything about it were theirs--a declaration which was certainly in\n",
      "earnest, so far as a prolonged visit was concerned. But they were\n",
      "anxious to continue their investigations of Yucatan, and having already\n",
      "arranged to go to Uxmal with an American gentleman residing at Merida,\n",

      "The second morning after their return they started for the ruins of\n",
      "Uxmal, which are about sixty miles from Merida. Doctor Bronson and Mr.\n",
      "Burbank, his American friend, rode in one volan coché, and Frank and\n",
      "Fred in another. A cart with the needed supply of provisions and cooking\n",
      "utensils had left on the previous day, and was to meet them at Uxmal,\n",
      "which contains no hotel or other accommodation for travellers. Lodgings\n",
      "are taken in some of the deserted and ruined buildings; and with a\n",

      "The road presented the same scenes as the one they had taken a few days\n",
      "before, and therefore does not need special description. At the first\n",
      "village on the road the vehicles halted to allow the panting mules to\n",
      "take breath and water, and our friends descended from their cramped\n",
      "positions to stretch their limbs. Mr. Burbank spoke a few words to some\n",
      "of the natives that gathered around them, and then asked the strangers\n",
      "to go with them to see a _heetzmek_.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: SCENE OF THE HEETZMEK.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Wondering what a heetzmek was, they followed to a house a few yards\n",
      "away, where a woman was walking around the dwelling carrying a very\n",
      "young child astride her hip. Having completed the circuit, she repeated\n",
      "it again and again, till she had walked five times around the dwelling,\n",
      "carrying the child as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a ceremony which corresponds to the christening of infants in\n",
      "other countries,\" said the gentleman. \"The woman that you see is the\n",
      "baby's godmother; the position in which the Yucateos carry their\n",
      "children astride the hip is like that of India and some other Asiatic\n",
      "countries. The heetzmek is performed when the infant is about four\n",
      "months old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The natives believe in the magic of the number five. You have seen the\n",
      "woman walk five times around the house as she carries the child. Five\n",
      "eggs have been buried in hot ashes, and as they break they will rouse\n",
      "the five senses of the infant; if they fail to open, it will be of only\n",
      "ordinary intelligence, but their breaking will insure extraordinary\n",
      "mental ability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably,\" remarked Frank, \"they take good care to have the ashes hot\n",
      "enough to make sure that the eggs will burst.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they are as intelligent as they want the child to be, they certainly\n",
      "will,\" replied Mr. Burbank. \"In addition to the egg test there is a\n",
      "further ceremony of putting into the infant's hands the implements it\n",
      "will use when matured. The godmother is held in great respect by the\n",
      "whole family, and especially by the child for whom she has stood\n",
      "sponsor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The heetzmek over, the journey was continued, the mules having rested\n",
      "sufficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nine o'clock in the forenoon, and about twenty-five miles of the\n",
      "journey had been made when the walls of the hacienda of Uayalké came in\n",
      "sight. The appetites of the youths were on a keen edge, and Frank\n",
      "remarked to Fred that he could breakfast off the hind-leg of a donkey,\n",
      "if only that ordinarily unattractive viand were presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I scent breakfast,\" responded Fred. \"They are famed for their\n",
      "hospitality in Yucatan, and we'll probably find what we want at this\n",
      "hacienda.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His prediction was verified, for hardly had he ceased speaking when the\n",
      "foremost carriage turned towards the yard of the hacienda, followed very\n",
      "naturally by the other. The drivers unhitched their mules beneath a\n",
      "wide-spreading tree in front of the residence of the manager, and\n",
      "proceeded to make themselves at home. The _mayordomo_ came out and\n",
      "welcomed the strangers, and without waiting for a suggestion from Mr.\n",
      "Burbank, whom he knew, he sent a servant to order breakfast. In a very\n",
      "short time it was ready, and the travellers sat down; tortillas,\n",
      "frijoles, stewed chicken, eggs, and fruit, disappeared in due course,\n",
      "and the keen appetites were keen no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How about the posterior limb of the _equus asinus_ now?\" whispered Fred\n",
      "to Frank, as they left the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Non possumus_,\" was the only answer that occurred to Frank. His views\n",
      "on the subject of edible things had materially changed in the last hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths made note of the fact that the hacienda of Uayalké was a\n",
      "large and evidently a very prosperous one. The manager told them that\n",
      "they had several thousand acres of land in henequin, and there were more\n",
      "than 1200 men and women employed about the establishment and in the\n",
      "fields. The engines and machinery were more ponderous and powerful than\n",
      "at the hacienda already described; and the buildings of the\n",
      "establishment, together with the huts of the laborers, formed quite a\n",
      "settlement. There was a deep cenoté, from which a troop of women were\n",
      "drawing water, by means of a wheel, with buckets on an endless rope; as\n",
      "fast as their jars were filled they carried them away in the direction\n",
      "of the garden, where the water was used for keeping bright the orange\n",
      "and other trees that cannot live without water.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: GARDEN OF THE HACIENDA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden, thus invigorated, was like a spot of green in a desert, and\n",
      "reminded the youths of some of the oases they had visited in their\n",
      "Oriental journeyings. Frank compared it to Biskra, in the Great Sahara,\n",
      "and Fred declared that he saw a striking resemblance to some of the\n",
      "gardens at the edge of the Libyan Desert. Beyond the garden in every\n",
      "direction was the dry and repellent land covered with the hardy\n",
      "henequin, which needs no water, or but the merest trifle of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not see an idler about the place, every one from the manager\n",
      "down seeming to be fully occupied. Mr. Burbank said that no hacienda in\n",
      "the whole country was better managed than this, and there was none where\n",
      "the laborers were better satisfied with their employer and employment.\n",
      "He added that here, as everywhere else in Yucatan, the laborers were\n",
      "constantly in debt to the establishment, and therefore were unable to\n",
      "quit work suddenly or \"go on strike.\" A laborer who is in debt cannot\n",
      "change employers, unless the new one assumes the responsibility of the\n",
      "obligation to the old; and to bring this about requires considerable\n",
      "negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a stay of two hours and more at the hacienda, the journey was\n",
      "continued. Six or seven miles farther on the travellers reached the\n",
      "cenoté of Mucuyché, and made a brief halt to examine it. The cavern is\n",
      "about forty feet deep, and the entrance is surrounded by a garden kept\n",
      "green by the water drawn from the never-failing source. Our friends\n",
      "descended by means of steps cut in the rock. These steps were overhung\n",
      "by stalactites, which furnished convenient holding-ground for nests of\n",
      "swallows and hornets in great numbers. What particularly pleased the\n",
      "youths was that they found here an abundance of the blind fishes that\n",
      "they sought in vain in their first exploration of underground Yucatan.\n",
      "There was the same abundance and variety of lizards and other creeping\n",
      "things as before; some of them were of goodly size, and Fred learned\n",
      "that they were iguanas, and that they often appeared at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you drive them away as soon as possible,\" he replied. \"They\n",
      "are not pleasant things to look at when one is eating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" Mr. Burbank answered, \"the iguana is a delicacy of\n",
      "which I have often partaken. He appears at table, not in his live state,\n",
      "but after passing through the hands of the cook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: NATIVE VILLAGE NEAR UXMAL.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred thought he did not want any iguana then or at any other time, and\n",
      "his mind was firmly made up on the subject. His views changed two or\n",
      "three days later when, after eating heartily of a delicious stew, which\n",
      "secured the praises of both Frank and himself, he learned that the stew\n",
      "aforesaid was nothing less than the despised iguana. He quietly remarked\n",
      "that great allowance must be made for prejudice, and then dismissed the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hours before sunset they reached a hacienda, where they received\n",
      "the same cordial reception as at Uayalké. It had been intended to\n",
      "complete the journey to Uxmal that day, but as the hour was late and\n",
      "darkness would certainly overtake them before their destination could be\n",
      "reached, Mr. Burbank decided to accept the pressing invitation of the\n",

      "The mules were unharnessed and led away to the stables, where they were\n",
      "bountifully fed on fresh grass cut and brought by the peons. There was a\n",
      "fine garden here filled with all sorts of tropical trees; and not the\n",
      "least interesting sight in the place was a large number of beehives of a\n",
      "very primitive character. They were nothing else than sections of a\n",
      "hollow log cut off with a saw, and the ends closed with dried mud, or\n",
      "with boards fitted in, like the head of a barrel.\n",

      "[Illustration: WHAT PERFUMES THE HONEY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank and Fred stood at a respectful distance as they looked at the\n",
      "beehives. They were mindful of the proverb which refers to the prudence\n",
      "of the burnt child; and having been stung by the honey insects on\n",
      "several occasions, they did not wish a repetition of the experience. Mr.\n",
      "Burbank walked fearlessly up to the hives and called to the youths to\n",
      "follow him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please excuse us,\" replied Frank; \"the bees may recognize you, as\n",
      "you've been here before, but they don't know us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind _them_,\" the gentleman answered, with a laugh. \"The bees in\n",
      "this country are stingless, and you run no risk in making their\n",
      "acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus assured, the youths advanced and found themselves unharmed. The\n",
      "bees circled about them in great numbers, but \"left no sting behind.\"\n",
      "Mr. Burbank told them that the hives were emptied every six or eight\n",
      "weeks, and thus the bees were kept busy the year round. Why they collect\n",
      "honey in a country where flowers are perpetually in bloom he could not\n",
      "understand. \"It speaks well for the industry of the insect,\" he\n",
      "remarked; \"he has no occasion to work, and only does so from the force\n",
      "of ancestral habit. He has some imitators among the human race, but by\n",
      "no means so generally as many of us might wish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While discussing the subject of bee-keeping in Yucatan they were called\n",
      "to supper, which was an excellent one, of purely Mexican character.\n",
      "Turtle soup, chile con carne, frijoles, tortillas, and other national\n",
      "dishes were served in abundance, and the meal ended with honey from the\n",
      "beehives which they had investigated. Frank and Fred had observed a\n",
      "delicious fragrance as they entered the room where supper was served,\n",
      "and were unable at first to discover its origin. All the scent of the\n",
      "finest flowers of Yucatan seemed to be gathered there. They looked\n",
      "around for floral baskets or bouquets, but none were visible. When the\n",
      "honey was served they found that this it was which furnished the\n",
      "fragrance, and they asked Mr. Burbank about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite right,\" he answered; \"it is the perfume of the honey that\n",
      "fills your nostrils. In some seasons of the year it is much greater than\n",

      "the stones remain. The columns are from fourteen to sixteen feet high,\n",
      "and the work of putting the stones in place was by no means small. The\n",

      "found, with several fine buildings upon it. The work of making the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wish we could extend our journey to Central America,\" said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: IN A CENTRAL AMERICAN FOREST.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I,\" answered his cousin, \"but I'm afraid Doctor Bronson would not\n",
      "consent. His plans do not include a journey farther south than Yucatan,\n",
      "and besides, I don't think he would relish the idea of making a trip\n",
      "through a region where the comforts of travel are as limited as they are\n",
      "between here and Panama.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They sounded the Doctor on the subject, but did not receive any\n",
      "encouragement. His arrangements were such that he was to be in New York\n",
      "by a date that would make it impossible to accomplish the proposed\n",
      "journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The youths cheerfully assented to the situation, and consoled themselves\n",
      "by collecting a fair stock of information about Central America and\n",
      "entering it in their note-books; Frank said this was the next best thing\n",
      "to seeing the country for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: GOVERNMENT PALACE, SAN JOSÉ.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Central America,\" wrote Frank, \"is about 900 miles long, and varies\n",
      "from 30 to 300 miles in width. It extends south about eleven degrees\n",
      "from the eighteenth parallel of north latitude, and is therefore\n",
      "entirely in the tropics. The geographers give it an area of 175,000\n",
      "square miles, and a population of something less than three millions,\n",
      "the greater portion being native-born Indians. The whites and creoles\n",
      "are nearly all of Spanish descent, as the country was conquered and\n",
      "occupied by the Spaniards soon after the Conquest of Mexico.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred suggested that a census of the snakes, lizards, birds, and beasts\n",
      "of Central America would give a large population, as it was known to\n",
      "abound in those things to a very liberal extent. He declared in advance\n",
      "that he would not accept the office of animal census-taker, as he had\n",
      "understood that the serpents were numerous and dangerous, as is the case\n",
      "in tropical countries generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was reading this morning,\" said he, \"of a snake of the constrictor\n",
      "species that was killed close to a hacienda where the writer of the\n",
      "narrative was stopping. It was fourteen feet long, and not unusually\n",
      "large of its kind. The people of the hacienda said it was fortunate that\n",
      "the creature had been despatched, as it would quite likely have killed\n",
      "one of the children; and they related many stories about babies being\n",
      "swallowed by these serpents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The same traveller, Mr. Wells, tells about a ceremony that he witnessed\n",
      "where a tamagasa, one of the most deadly snakes of Central America, was\n",
      "burned alive in the public square of a village. Two natives had found\n",
      "the snake basking in the sun; one threw his poncho over the reptile\n",
      "while the other held its head to the ground with a forked stick till its\n",
      "mouth could be sewed up, so that it could do no harm. The snake was\n",
      "about three feet long. The ceremony took place in the evening, and the\n",
      "village priest pronounced a malediction upon the creature before it was\n",
      "consigned to the flames. No remedy is known for the bite of this\n",
      "serpent, nor for that of the taboba, another venomous product of Central\n",
      "America.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To go on with the country,\" said Frank, when Fred paused at the end of\n",
      "his snake story, \"we will remark that Central America comprises five\n",
      "republics which are independent of each other, Costa Rica, Honduras,\n",
      "Guatemala, San Salvador, and Nicaragua. Down to 1823 they were colonies\n",
      "of Spain; in that year they formed themselves into a federal republic of\n",
      "States and declared their independence. They continued thus until 1839,\n",
      "when they dissolved their federation and became independent of each\n",
      "other. Since then they have united again on two or three occasions, but\n",
      "have not remained so for any length of time. Several attempts at a\n",
      "federation (one of them in 1888), have resulted in nothing. Now and then\n",
      "the republics have wars among themselves, but the rest of the world goes\n",
      "on as if nothing had happened, as the moon did when the dog barked at\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The governments of the States of Central America are republican in\n",
      "form, modified by revolution and assassination; happily these\n",
      "modifications are not applied as frequently nowadays as in former times,\n",
      "but they are by no means unknown. To show how revolutions are started\n",
      "and how they sometimes turn out, let us take a page from the history of\n",
      "Costa Rica.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: CENTRAL AMERICAN LODGINGS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Frank read from \"The Capitals of Spanish America\" the account\n",
      "of how the Government of that republic was overthrown, and a new one\n",
      "established in 1871. Substantially it was as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Congress of Costa Rica had caused a railway to be surveyed from\n",
      "ocean to ocean across the State. It was necessary to seek foreign aid\n",
      "for the construction of the line, and the two banking houses at San\n",
      "José, the capital city, were rivals for the appointment of Government\n",
      "agent to negotiate the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defeated banker was, like his rival, an Englishman (married to a\n",
      "Costa Rican lady), and the capital of his bank was English. In revenge,\n",
      "and with a view to business, he determined to overthrow the Government\n",
      "and set up one of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end he negotiated with a cowboy named Thomas Guardia, who had\n",
      "made a reputation as commander of a small force of cavalry in a war with\n",
      "Nicaragua, to head a revolution, under promise of money and position.\n",
      "The army of the republic comprised about 250 men, and they were easily\n",
      "overcome by Guardia, who assembled half that number of cowboys and rode\n",
      "suddenly into San José one morning, capturing the whole place by\n",
      "surprise. It was one of the \"revolutions before breakfast,\" to which\n",
      "Central America is accustomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: BANANA PLANTATION IN COSTA RICA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardia imprisoned all the Government officials who did not run away,\n",
      "and appointed himself Dictator. Among the fugitives was the\n",
      "constitutional President, and therefore it was necessary to hold an\n",
      "election for a new President, Guardia being made provisional President\n",
      "until the election could be held. The English banker, who had started\n",
      "the revolution, named his father-in-law as the candidate for President,\n",
      "and it was expected that he would be elected without opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardia concluded, from his experience as Dictator, that it was not a\n",
      "bad thing to be President, and when the election came off he ordered his\n",
      "officers to secure the position for him, and leave the banker's\n",
      "father-in-law out in the cold. He was unanimously elected; 2000 votes\n",
      "were cast in a population of 200,000, and Guardia received them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was unable to read or write when he became President, but he was a\n",
      "man of decided ability, called wise counsellors to aid him, did\n",
      "everything he could for the advancement of his country, and altogether\n",
      "made an excellent ruler for the little republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: DON BERNARDO DE SOTO, PRESIDENT OF COSTA RICA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The present President of Costa Rica is Don Bernardo de Soto, who was a\n",
      "favorite of Guardia, and is a man of good education. He graduated at the\n",
      "college in San José, and completed his studies in Europe; and since his\n",
      "elevation to the high office he has shown ability and intelligence in\n",
      "the management of public affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During their investigation of Central America the youths met Mr. Wilson,\n",
      "of New York, an old friend of Doctor Bronson's, who had just returned\n",
      "from a visit to Honduras. He readily replied to all the questions that\n",
      "were propounded by Frank and Fred, and his answers may be summed up as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: GEN. LUIS BOGRAN, PRESIDENT OF HONDURAS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found Honduras very interesting,\" said Mr. Wilson, \"and was sorry\n",
      "that I could not remain longer. The country seems to have great promise,\n",
      "as it is exceedingly fertile, and the mountain regions contain great\n",
      "quantities of gold and silver. All tropical fruits grow there in\n",
      "abundance, and there might be a large product of coffee and sugar. At\n",
      "present the exports consist chiefly of cattle, mahogany, hides, and\n",
      "rubber, of a total value of about two millions of dollars annually, and\n",
      "the imports are nearly as much. The expenses of conducting the\n",
      "government are not far from one million dollars a year, sometimes\n",
      "exceeding the revenue, and sometimes falling below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honduras has been unfortunate financially,\" continued the gentleman,\n",
      "\"as it contracted a loan in England for building a railway across the\n",
      "country from ocean to ocean, and the greater part of the money went into\n",
      "private hands and not in the most honest way imaginable. Twenty-seven\n",
      "million dollars' worth of bonds were negotiated in London, under the\n",
      "guarantee of the Government, and all that the country has to show for\n",
      "this large amount of money is about sixty miles of poorly built railway.\n",
      "Since 1872 the interest on this loan has not been paid, and probably it\n",
      "never will be; in the negotiations the Government and the purchasers of\n",
      "the bonds were deceived, and the country never obtained more than a\n",
      "small fraction of the benefit that was promised.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: TEGUCIGALPA, CAPITAL OF HONDURAS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Negotiations are now going on for wiping out the debt by issuing new\n",
      "bonds for a part of it, and creating a new loan by which the\n",
      "Interoceanic Railway can be completed and other railways constructed.\n",
      "The President of Honduras, General Bogran, is a man of great enterprise,\n",
      "and has done much for the country since he took possession of his\n",
      "office. His predecessor had built a fine boulevard from the capital part\n",
      "way to the Pacific coast, but from that point there was only a\n",
      "mule-track, the same that had been there for three hundred years.\n",
      "General Bogran made a contract with some American engineers to build a\n",
      "wagon-road from the coast to the end of this boulevard, and another from\n",
      "the capital, Tegucigalpa, to Yuscaran, the centre of the principal\n",
      "mining district.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: STREET IN YUSCARAN.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please tell us about the mines of Honduras,\" said Frank, as Mr. Wilson\n",
      "paused for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, I'll do so with great pleasure,\" was the reply. \"Honduras\n",
      "was the first part of the main-land of North America visited by Columbus\n",
      "and his companions, and as soon as Cortez had completed the conquest of\n",
      "Mexico and established himself firmly on its soil he proceeded to the\n",
      "subjugation of Honduras. From the time of the Conquest down to 1820 the\n",
      "mines of Honduras yielded enormously of gold and silver; the Government\n",
      "took as its share twenty per cent. of the gross product, and whenever a\n",
      "district proved to be unusually rich the King acknowledged the\n",
      "good-fortune by 'decorating' the place. This was a much more economical\n",
      "proceeding than reducing the taxes or granting a sum in money for public\n",
      "improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you don't understand me,\" said Mr. Wilson, as he observed a\n",
      "puzzled expression on the faces of the youths. \"When I was at\n",
      "Tegucigalpa I examined some old documents in the Government library, and\n",
      "came upon one containing the following paragraph:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'The flourishing state of the mining interests and the large returns\n",
      "they brought the Crown influenced the King, so that on the 17th day of\n",
      "July, 1768, there was given to the _pueblos_ (villages) of San Miguel,\n",
      "Tegucigalpa, and Heredia the honorable title of _villas_ (cities).'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A decree of that sort is exactly like conferring a decoration on an\n",
      "individual,\" continued the gentleman. \"It costs nothing to the giver,\n",
      "and makes the recipient proud of his distinction, at least that is\n",
      "supposed to be the purpose of a decoration.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: OLD BRIDGE AT TEGUCIGALPA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To show you how rich were the mines of Honduras, let me instance the\n",
      "Guayabilla mine in the Yuscaran district. It is about fifty miles east\n",
      "of Tegucigalpa, and near the line of Nicaragua, at an elevation of 3250\n",
      "feet above the sea-level. In the old days the ore was so rich that the\n",
      "owners of the mine did not reduce any that yielded less than sixty\n",
      "dollars per ton, and after the mine was deserted $60,000 was obtained\n",
      "from it by a gentleman who now lives in the country. From 1812 to 1817\n",
      "the King's fifths from this mine amounted to $400,000, so that in five\n",
      "years the product of the mine was $2,000,000. In 1837 the mine had been\n",
      "worked to a depth of 300 feet, when the miners were impeded by water.\n",
      "Accordingly they prepared to abandon the mine, and did so by removing\n",
      "the pillars for the sake of the ore they contained. Of course the mine\n",
      "caved in soon after the pillars were removed, and the same was the case\n",
      "with other mines that were similarly maltreated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred asked Mr. Wilson how many productive mines there were in Honduras\n",
      "during the time of its occupation by the Spaniards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to that I cannot say exactly,\" was the reply, \"but at a rough\n",
      "calculation there were not fewer than fifty in the Yuscaran district\n",
      "that were once active and paid royalties to the King. In the Choluteca\n",
      "and Tegucigalpa districts there were fully 100 mines, so that we may\n",
      "safely count 150 in all. Under the enlightened policy of President\n",
      "Bogran Americans and other foreigners have interested themselves in the\n",
      "mineral wealth of Honduras, and several of the mines are now being\n",
      "operated with modern appliances, which give promise of great results.\n",
      "Some of them are producing ore in such quantities as to fully justify\n",
      "their former reputation. Under the old system there was no arrangement\n",
      "for getting rid of superfluous water and foul air. Modern pumping and\n",
      "ventilating machinery has been adopted, and the old annoyances that\n",
      "hindered operations or suspended them altogether will be of\n",
      "comparatively little consequence.\"\n",

      "\"It received its name,\" said Mr. Wilson, \"from two Indian words\n",
      "signifying 'mountain of silver.' It is about 3000 feet above sea-level,\n",
      "and eighty miles from the seaport, on the Bay of Fonseca. It has\n",
      "15,000 inhabitants, its houses are of adobe, and the streets narrow and\n",

      "In the public square there is a bronze equestrian statue of Francisco\n",

      "that no other routes have been discovered since his time. The world's\n",

      "between the English and Spanish Governments prevented any active\n",
      "operations towards the making of the canal. In 1823 the President of\n",
      "Nicaragua opened negotiations with the Government of the United States\n",
      "with that object in view, but nothing was accomplished. In 1826 the\n",

      "years later the Government of New Grenada permitted a survey of the\n",
      "Isthmus of Panama for the same object. In 1844 Nicaragua gave a\n",

      "for the entire distance. On the basis of this book, some English\n",

      "The route of the proposed canal will be entirely through the State of\n",

      "will be on the south bank of the San Juan River, which is the dividing\n",

      "surface of Lake Nicaragua is 110 feet above the level of the sea, and to\n",

      "is 110 miles long by 35 wide, and is a beautiful sheet of water in a\n",

      "For convenience of description we will suppose the canal to be in three\n",

      "Greytown, on the Caribbean Sea, at the mouth of the San Juan River, and\n",
      "extends to the Arroyo de las Cascades, a distance of nineteen and\n",
      "one-half miles. This division contains sixty-three per cent. of the\n",
      "excavation required for the whole canal; it will include the digging of\n",
      "a channel through the low lands of the coast, and then through rising\n",
      "ground and hills, where locks must be made to raise the canal to the\n",
      "level of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the eastern division a dam across the San Juan River will\n",
      "fill the channel of that stream to a depth sufficient for the passage of\n",
      "sea going vessels, and also create a lake, or basin, where ships may\n",
      "pass each other, and also halt for repairs if any are needed. In some\n",
      "places the river must be dredged to reach the requisite depth, but these\n",
      "points are not numerous or difficult. The river is 1000 feet wide, so\n",
      "that ships will have plenty of room for moving either way, and there\n",
      "will be about eighty-three miles of river navigation from the dam to the\n",
      "lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Lake Nicaragua the distance from the head of the San Juan River to\n",
      "the beginning of the western division is fifty-six and one-half miles,\n",
      "and here there is abundant depth of water except in one place where some\n",
      "rock-blasting and dredging will be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rio Lajas, on the western shore of the lake, will be the end of the\n",
      "middle, or navigable, portion of the canal, and the beginning of the\n",
      "western division, which extends seventeen and one-quarter miles to the\n",
      "Pacific Ocean. On this division ships coming from the east will descend\n",
      "by four locks, while those from the west will rise by the same means.\n",
      "The last of the locks, the one nearest the Pacific, will have a varying\n",
      "depth to accommodate itself to the rise and fall of the ocean tide,\n",
      "which is about nine feet. The entrance of this lock will be of a funnel\n",
      "shape, and a port will be formed by throwing out jetties on each side of\n",
      "the little bay of Brito, and converting it into a secure harbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the eastern end of the canal jetties will be thrown out in the same\n",
      "way to form a harbor at the mouth of the San Juan River close to the old\n",
      "harbor of Greytown, which has been partially filled by the sands brought\n",
      "down by the river, and has a depth of only twenty-one feet at its\n",
      "entrance. The current of the river will be utilized for washing out the\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: FORT SAN CARLOS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The estimates of the engineers,\" was the reply, \"place the cost of the\n",
      "whole work at $60,000,000 in round figures; some of them make it ten or\n",
      "twelve millions less, but as estimates nearly always fall short of the\n",
      "actual cost, we will suppose that the figures are $100,000,000. I think\n",
      "it is safe to say the canal can be built for that amount of money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How does that compare with the Suez and the Panama canals?\" Fred asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cost of the Suez Canal was $100,000,000, and it has been a very\n",
      "profitable enterprise. Double that amount of money has been expended on\n",
      "the Panama Canal, and only one-fourth the work is done; even if it\n",
      "should ever be completed, the revenues cannot be sufficient to pay a\n",
      "good dividend on the cost after deducting the running expenses. The\n",
      "Nicaragua Canal will have a great advantage over the one at Panama, for\n",
      "the reason that the latter is in the region of equatorial calms, while\n",
      "the former is within the sweep of steady winds. Consequently the Panama\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can best answer that question,\" replied the Doctor, \"by quoting from\n",
      "a writer in _Harper's Magazine_. He says the wheat trade between our\n",
      "Pacific coast and Europe requires a million tons of shipping, and as\n",
      "each ship must pass twice through the canal, this trade alone would be\n",
      "two millions of tons a year. The coasting trade between the Atlantic and\n",
      "Pacific ports of the United States would add another million tons, and\n",
      "the tea trade between Europe and China and Japan, the guano and nitrate\n",
      "trade of South America, the whaling trade of the Pacific, the wool trade\n",
      "between Australia and Europe, would altogether bring the business of the\n",
      "canal up to five or six millions of tons a year. At two dollars a ton,\n",
      "the toll that is charged by the Suez Canal, there would be a revenue of\n",
      "ten or twelve million dollars without considering the growth of the\n",
      "world's commerce from year to year. It is estimated that the running\n",
      "expenses and repairs to the canal would not exceed half a million\n",
      "dollars annually, so that there would be a good profit on the outlay of\n",
      "$100,000,000.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred asked what saving of distances would be effected by the canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: CENTRAL AMERICAN HACIENDA.]\n",

      "\"Between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States,\" was the\n",
      "reply, \"the saving would be 8000 or 9000 miles over the Cape Horn route.\n",

      "of 500 to 3000 miles over any route except by Suez, and between Europe\n",
      "and Japan sailing-vessels will save 3000 miles by taking the Nicaragua\n",
      "route. There can be no reasonable doubt that the world's commerce will\n",
      "be greatly benefited by the opening of the proposed canal, and in a few\n",
      "years we may see it operated to its full capacity, of every year passing\n",
      "eleven thousand ships from ocean to ocean.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "She even went to the fantastic expense of televiewing there to talk\n",

      "size-classification, beauty-index, fertility tests, personality scores,\n",
      "aptitudes, psyche-rating and so on, and so on and so on. It was like\n",

      "After that she did not know what to do. She had stood for nearly twenty\n",
      "minutes before the document file, listening, thinking desperately that\n",

      "come back. She had made herself refreshment. She had sat with the\n",
      "filled-out documents on her lap looking, from time to time, longingly\n",
      "at the entrance-ramp. But he had not come back. Finally, with a low\n",
      "moaning sound, she had pushed the papers through the document file\n",

      "\n",
      "Now she knew that whatever else happened, the Protection People would\n",

      "show in her favor if she were to get together the things they would\n",
      "need to take with them. She could do this without seeing them and\n",

      "when you considered that she had televiewed to Earth. She cried hard\n",

      "she thought the amount might even stretch to include a picture of\n",
      "her. She did not know. She did not even know if she would be expected\n",
      "to be nude or dressed for the picture. In the end, she decided not to\n",

      "She took a dictator and said into it: \"Dear children, I am leaving you\n",
      "1300 credit.\" She stopped then and shook her head. The tears made it\n",
      "so that she could not see, and she did not seem to be able to think.\n",
      "\"Correction,\" she sobbed \"Erase preceding. Dear Children of Yan, I make\n",
      "you this gift of 1300. I am sure that your excellence will continue to\n",

      "account. It was almost as though he had expected her to try to get\n",
      "away. She wished now that she had thought before taking action. There\n",
      "might have been some way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She must have fallen asleep. The morning announcements came on as\n",
      "usual, waking her. She listened to the instructions for that day, and\n",
      "the areas announced as forbidden. She made no effort, however, to\n",

      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a very great effort she got up and shut off the children's ramp,\n",
      "so that they could not come down. She knew how much this would count in\n",
      "her favor. Then she began, as hurriedly as she could, to collect the\n",
      "things they would need. She knew that she could not possibly get the\n",
      "things together in time, and that so late an effort was more likely\n",
      "to count against her. She was not even close to finished when the\n",
      "announcer flashed on.\n",
